Singapore and Malaysia, with its early enforcement of containment measures and the swift rollout of double vaccination and booster shots, managed to resume economic activities early. Our biggest market in China, with a much larger population and more complex healthcare infrastructure needs, had to implement a strict zero-COVID policy that included city lockdowns, quarantines and mass testing to contain the spread of COVID-19. As a result, China entered into a period of slow growth and reported GDP growth of 3.0% for 2022, well below the 5.5% target set by the Chinese Government*. Our China operations suffered from a sharp fall in demand for commercial diesel engines. Although China ended its zero-COVID policy in December 2022 and has since moved to endemic phase, market demand for medium and heavy-duty diesel engines is likely to be moderate in the initial phases of China’s recovery as existing truck fleets are re-deployed and inventory stockpiles digested. \\nINFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENT \\nCALLS FOR EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES\\nThe Russian-Ukraine war that started \\nin February 2022 had a major impact on commodity prices, especially on precious metals, energy and coal. Our input costs had risen during the year and while prices have retreated from the peaks when the war broke out, they remain at elevated levels. We responded by raising our prices when possible and looked to productivity CHAIRMAN’S \\nMESSAGE\\nKWEK LENG PECK\\nExecutive Chairman   I AM CONFIDENT THAT \\nOUR EMPLOYEES WILL \\nCONTINUE TO BUILD AND STRENGTHEN OUR OPERATIONAL RESILIENCE AND INNOVATE TO STAY AHEAD.gains to help mitigate some of the cost \\nincreases. The inflationary environment is \\nlikely to stay for some time and Central Banks in major economies globally, with the exception of China, have maintained a hawkish stance by raising interest rates substantially. The Group has responded by preserving our cash and cutting back on non-essential capital expenditures. We also focused on improving our cash flow management and enforcing discipline in our credit control. \\nOPERATIONAL RESILIENCE STILL KEY \\nTO LONG-TERM SUCCESS\\nHLA started from humble beginnings in \\nthe 1940s to become a diversified Asian multinational today with core expertise in Building Materials and Powertrain Solutions. Two of our corporate values of “Keeping the Customer First” and “Minding the Details that Matters” still hold true today. The Building Materials business is vertically integrated from granite to concrete and this helps to reinforce our supply chain reliability. We collaborate with long-term joint venture partner Taiheiyo Cement Corporation to develop deep expertise in Portland Fly Ash Cement (“PFAC”) concrete products and today, it is our core sustainable concrete mix products for all projects in Singapore. Our Powertrain Solutions business in China under Yuchai has developed a wide range of products that meet the stringent National VI emission standards, and an upgraded Yuchai S04220-61 series of engines have obtained European certification UN R49.07, which indicates that Yuchai engine technology has reached the world’s most advanced level.\\nOUR TWO ACQUISITIONS MADE DURING \\nCOVID-19 LOCKDOWN HAVE DONE WELL\\nAs previously reported, in 2021 we acquired \\na 20% stake in BRC Asia Limited (“BRC”) and 100% of all the limestone quarry assets from MCB Quarries Sdn Berhad (“MCB”) located adjacent to ours in Ipoh, Perak, adding substantially to our limestone reserves.BRC is a market leader in providing steel reinforcement solutions in Singapore, offering standard length rebar, cut and bend services, prefabrication services as well as standard and customised welded wire mesh for the building and construction industry. I am pleased to share that BRC has reported record earnings in the financial year ended 30 September 2022 with Profit after Tax of S$90.2 million. MCB has resumed full operations after the lifting of Movement Control Order, and is supplying to our cement production.\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nWe have made strong progress in shaping our Sustainability agenda and are on track to meet the 2025 goals. We have defined the three Sustainability pillars that are critical to the success of our business strategy and create long-term value for our stakeholders - “Driving Innovation for a Low-Carbon and Circular Economy”, “Empowering our People and Communities” and “Building Resilience for the Long-Term.” I encourage you to follow the progress in the 2022 Sustainability Report that will be published in digital format on 5 April 2023 on the websites of SGX and HLA.\\n* https:/ /www.reuters.com/article/china-parliament-gdp-idUSKBN2V700BYuchai employee conducting routine checks on engine component \\nmachining line.09\\nRELIABLE • RESILIENT • RESPONSIBLE HONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

       " Document(metadata={'source': './Hong Leong Annual Report 2022.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='AWARDS AND RECOGNITION\\nIn recognition of the Group’s commitment to \\nuphold the highest standards of corporate governance and sustainability efforts to improve business practices, HLA was recognised in May 2022 in the inaugural Nikkei-FT Statista Asia Pacific List as one of Asia’s Climate Leaders 2022. In July 2022, HLA went on to garner a joint Silver Award for the Best Managed Board and a Bronze Award for the Best Annual Report amongst listed companies with market capitalisation of S$300 million to less than S$1 billion at the Singapore Corporate Awards 2022. In August 2022, the Group also won the Gold Award in the Manufacturing and Distributing Category for the Best Traditional Annual Report and subsequently, the Grand Award for Best in Singapore at the 2022 International Annual Report Competition Awards. On the Corporate Governance front, HLA improved its ranking to 21\\nst place from 23rd position with a score of \\n100 points in the Singapore Governance and Transparency Index 2022.\\nDIVIDENDS\\nWith our satisfactory performance and strong balance sheet, we are able to maintain a dividend payment to our shareholders. The Board has recommended a first and final dividend of S$0.02 per share for FY2022.\\nLOOKING FORWARD\\nThe operating environment remains uncertain with the impact of the war and geopolitical rivalry that can further alter the dynamics of the supply chain and sustain high inflation. As such, a slower growth is expected in the coming year. Nevertheless, I am confident that our employees will continue to build and strengthen our operational resilience, anticipate problems along the way and innovate to stay ahead. \\nThe Group will also be exploring capital \\nmarkets initiatives to enhance its long-term value for shareholders and stakeholders.\\nAPPRECIATION\\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to express my thanks to all our customers, suppliers, joint venture partners and business associates for their trust and support that they have given us, and to our employees for living the Corporate Values and making us a reliable partner to all our stakeholders. I would also like to thank my fellow Board members for their invaluable contribution, advice and guidance. Finally, wishing everyone a safe and healthy 2023.\\nKwek Leng Peck\\nExecutive Chairman24 March 2023Employees inspecting the production line at Tasek各位股东：\\n我谨代表董事会欣然提呈丰隆亚洲(简称“HLA”或“集团”)截至\\n2022年12月31日财年(“2022财年”)的年度报告。\\n疫情成为地方性流行病，市场迎来转机\\n回顾2022年，各地市场的复苏步调不一。新加坡和马来西亚市场方面，在早期有效遏制疫情的措施以及迅速推出两针疫苗接种和加强针的政策支持下，经济活动恢复得较快。集团最大的市场——中国，由于人口众多，医疗基础设施需求更加复杂，不得不实施严格动态清零政策，包括封城、隔离和大规模核酸检测，以遏制新冠病毒的传播。在疫情冲击下，中国进入经济增长较慢的时期，2022年国内生产总值(简称 “GDP” )仅增长3.0%，低于\\n中国政府设定的5.5%的目标。我们在中国的业务因商用柴油发动态机需求急剧下降而受到影响。尽管中国于2022年12月解除清零政策，自此步入与冠病共存阶段，但由于现有卡车车辆重新投入运营加上现有库存有待售出，在中国经济复苏的初始阶段，市场对中型和重型发动机的需求将保持平稳。 \\n通胀环境需要采取非常措施\\n2022年2月俄乌战争爆发，对大宗商品价格造成了重大影响，特别是对贵金属、能源和煤炭的影响。这一年，我们的投入成本有所上升，虽然价格已从战争爆发时的峰值回落，但仍处于高位。为应对这种情势，我们在情况允许下提高价格，并通过提高生产力缓解一些成本增加压力。通货膨胀预计将会持续一段时间，除中国外，全球主要经济体的央行都保持着鹰派立场，大幅加息。为此，集团确保现金储备充裕、审慎地控制非必要的资本支出，以作应对。我们也同时专注于改善现金流管理以及实施严谨的信用管理。\\n运营韧性仍是长期致胜关键\\n丰隆亚洲于1940创立，距今已发展成为在建筑材料和动力传动系统领域拥有核心技术专长的亚洲多元化跨国企业。我们始终奉行“客户至上”、“关注重要细节”的企业价值观。集团建筑材料业务从花岗岩到混凝土的一体化产业链，有助加强我们供应链的可靠性。我们与长期合资伙伴Taiheiyo Cement Corporation 合作，开发粉煤灰\\n硅酸盐水泥(简称 “PFAC” )混凝土产品方面的精湛技术，  \\n如今， 该产品已成为我们的核心可持续混凝土混合产品，应用于我们在新加坡的各项项目。我们设在中国玉柴旗下的动力传动系统业务已经开发出一系列符合严格国六排放标准的产品，升级版的玉柴S04220-61系列发动机同时还获得了欧洲认证UN R49.07 欧六E阶段排放， 证明玉柴发动机技术已达到世界\\n顶尖水平。\\n新冠疫情封控期间完成的两项收购项目业绩良好\\n如前所述，我们在2021年收购了 BRC Asia Limited  \\n(简称“BRC”)20%的股份，以及 MCB Quarries Sdn Berhad  \\n(简称“MCB” )位于霹雳州怡保市的全部石灰石采矿场资产，矿\\n场位置恰好与我们的矿场为邻，大大增加了我们的石灰石储备。BRC 是新加坡钢筋解决方案市场的领先者，为建筑行业\\n提供标准长度的钢筋、切割折弯服务、预制服务以及标准和定制焊接网。我很高兴通报，在截至2022年9月30日的财政年度，BRC 盈利创下新高，税后利润达至9,020万新元。MCB采董事长 \\n致辞\\n矿场在行动管制令取消后，已全面恢复运行，为我们的水泥生\\n产提供原料。\\n可持续发展\\n我们在制定可持续发展议程方面取得了较大进展，并逐步迈进2025年目标。为了确保我们的业务战略的有效执行、以及利益相关者创造长期价值，我们确立了可持续发展的三大支柱——“推动低碳和循环经济创新”、“向员工和社区赋权”、“培养长期韧性”。2022年可持续发展报告将于2023年4月5日发布，并将在新交所网站和公司网站提供电子文档，请大家及时关注。\\n奖项与认可\\n2022年5月，丰隆亚洲在首份“ Nikkei-FT Statista 亚太名\\n单”(Nikkei-FT Statista Asia Pacific List )中被评为“2022年\\n度亚太区气候领袖企业”( Asia’s Climate Leaders 2022)\\n之一，表彰集团在公司治理和可持续发展工作中承诺坚持最高标准。2022年7月，丰隆亚洲在2022年度新加坡企业奖评选中，同获颁“最佳董事会”银奖及“最佳年报”铜奖  \\n(市值3至10亿新元区间)。2022年8月，集团还在2022年度国际年报比赛 (2022 International Annual Report \\nCompetition Awards )中获得了制造和分销组别“最佳传统年\\n报金奖” (Best Traditional Annual Report) ，随后又获颁了“\\n新加坡头名大奖” (Grand Award for Best in Singapore )\\n。在\\n公司治理方面，丰隆亚洲在2022年新加坡治理与透明度指数排名中，以100分的得分从第23位跃升至第21位。\\n股息\\n鉴于集团总体业绩良好加上资产负债表强劲，我们能够保持持续向股东派发股息。董事会提议为2022财年派发每股0.02新元的年终股息。\\n展望未来\\n在战争和地缘政治竞争的影响之下，经营环境仍然面临着不确定性，并且会进一步影响供应链的动态亦同时延续高通胀状况。因此，预计未来一年增长将会放缓。尽管如此，我坚信全体员工会继续建设并加强我们的运营韧性，未雨绸缪，并通过创新保持领先地位。集团也将探索各种资本市场机遇，为股东和利益相关者增加长期价值。\\n致意与感谢\\n在此，我谨代表董事会，向所有客户、供应商、合资伙伴和业务伙伴致以衷心的感谢，感谢大家给予的信任和支持；感谢全体员工践行企业价值观，让我们成为所有利益相关者的可靠伙伴。我也要感谢全体董事作出的宝贵贡献以及建议和指导。  \\n最后，祝愿大家2023年平安康健。\\n郭令栢\\n董事长2023年3月24日\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

The Russia-Ukraine war that began in February 2022 added more anxieties to the already fragile global supply chain and increased the input costs significantly across the board. Our Building Materials business in Singapore and Malaysia suffered to some degree from labour shortages with strict entry controls for migrant workers. Construction projects in Singapore also slowed down due to overall industry concerns on health and safety issues like industrial accidents and dengue outbreak which needed time to address. \\nMainly due to COVID-19 induced market \\nconditions in China, the Group reported lower Revenues of S$3.9 billion in FY2022  (FY2021: S$4.9 billion), down 21.3%.

Further margin improvements can be achieved when output volume starts to increase. The Powertrain Solutions business has been focusing on keeping costs down and innovating to stay ahead.\\nIn Singapore, the re-start of projects in the \\nconstruction sector allowed the Group’s Building Materials business to record improvement in performance, both in terms of volume and pricing. In Malaysia, while the recovery momentum continued as the country moved into COVID-19 endemic phase, the credit environment remained weak, and higher input costs affected our downstream concrete business. The upstream business of clinker and cement production and sales did better. The Group continues to focus on expanding our logistic solutions and achieving greater efficiency with our integrated model in our Building Materials business. \\nThe Group generated positive Net Cash \\nFlows from Operating Activities of S$37.6 million in FY2022.\\nAs interest rates have risen substantially, it is \\neven more important for us to manage our cash flow and remain financially strong. We continue to divest assets that are non-core. In the first quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of a 19,894 sq. metre of freehold land and property under Rex Plastics (Malaysia) that had remained dormant for some time.\\nPOWERTRAIN SOLUTIONS\\nGuangxi Yuchai Machinery Company Limited(“GYMCL” or “Yuchai”) is a leading manufacturer and distributor for on- and off-road Powertrain Solutions business and applications in China. It is also involved in the development and sale of new energy solutions in hybrid power, electric and fuel cell development for the Chinese commercial vehicles market.\\n321,256 units of engines were sold in FY2022, \\ndown 29.7% from 456,791 a year ago. The decrease was mainly attributable to the on-road truck and bus segments and in particular, the medium and heavy-duty engines, as demand was affected by the COVID-19 outbreaks and frequent city lockdowns. The Marine Power and Genset segment also saw a decline in unit sales as there were far less outages in power supply during the year. Only the off-road Agricultural and Industrial engines sales were not as badly hit by the slowdown. Our new energy vehicle business registered a sale of 6,327 units during the year as compared to 501 units the previous year, which is a small but important achievement. \\nAs a result of lower unit sales, net revenues \\nfor the Powertrain Solutions business dropped by 26.3% to S$3.3 billion. At the Profit after Tax level, S$67.0 million profits were reported in FY2022 as compared to S$85.7 million the previous year, a drop of 21.8% year-on-year. \\nNew Energy Solutions Key to the FutureYuchai has invested in research and its \\ndevelopment to improve its product offerings and in new energy solutions.\\nDuring the year, Yuchai teamed up with \\npartners and customers to develop new energy solutions. In March 2022, it formed a joint venture with Beijing Xingshunda to accelerate the development, manufacture and sale of fuel cell powertrain systems as well as core fuel cell power system components for the Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei markets. In September 2022, its new energy solutions subsidiary, Yuchai Xin-Lan New Energy Power Technology Co., Ltd. (“Yuchai-Xin-Lan”) developed and integrated a 3.5 tonne electric drive axle into an EV light duty bus from Guangxi Shenlong for the Nanning bus market.  Another example is Inner Mongolia Easy-Move Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. which launched the EM200, its first domestically-made 200-metric tonne smart mining truck featuring Yuchai Xin-Lan’s 300 kW high-power range extender powertrain system. It will improve the payload management efficiency, lower carbon emissions and provide intelligent control. \\nIt is important to keep in mind that these \\ncollaborations on new energy solutions will take some time to realise its full potential, and the success is dependent on the broader infrastructure development and cost competitiveness of the product offering. Yuchai is committed to developing new energy solutions as they are key to the future, and is fully aligned with the Chinese Government’s plan to achieve its national emission targets. \\nBUILDING MATERIALS\\nOur Building Materials business in Singapore benefited from the construction rebound as many projects re-started last year. Demand was strong and according to the Building Construction Authority (“BCA”), construction demand for 2022 reached S$29.8 billion, led by residential and infrastructure projects in both public and private sectors*. This has translated into favourable demand for ready-mixed concrete and the forecast is for demand to remain stable in 2023. In Malaysia, the construction sector registered a growth of 8.8% in 2022 after two years in the declining trend**. Our Building Materials business’s combined sales in Singapore and Malaysia reached S$585.4 million in FY2022, up 24.3% from S$471.1 million a year ago. Including our associated company results, Profit after Tax increased to S$45.6 million, up 61.9% from S$28.2 million in 2021.Investing for Greater Productivity\\nI. S tate-of-the-art Singapore \\nmanufacturing facility - Integrated Construction and Prefabricated Hub (“ICPH”) officially launched\\nIn December 2022, we obtained temporary occupation permit for our ICPH located in Pulau Punggol Bharat. The facility is the latest addition to our Group’s Precast innovation as we move towards higher automation and reinforce our position as a significant player in Singapore with enhanced ability to deliver products of higher specification. This is in line with the Singapore Government’s plan to improve construction productivity with the adoption of Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (“DfMA”) technologies. We expect demand for precast concrete, in particular Advanced Precast Concrete System (“APCS”) and Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (“PPVC”), to increase over the next few years.\\nNewly branded 12m3 ready-mix concrete trucks under Island Concrete\\n* https:/ /www1.bca.gov.sg/\\n** https:/ /www.dosm.gov.my/\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

Higher Pr oductivity with the Launch of \\n12-cubic metre Trucks\\nDuring the year, we became the very first \\ncompany in Singapore to obtain regulatory approval to roll out 12-cubic metre ready-mix concrete trucks. This innovation is expected to help reduce the number of truck trips overall and in doing so, reduce the traffic on the road and the demand for truck drivers. Over time, we expect productivity to increase by about 30% as compared to 9-cubic metre ready-mix concrete trucks. \\nIII. C ommencement of Ready-Mixed \\nConcrete (“RMC”) eco-system batching plant operations at Jurong Port in first half 2023\\nWe will be moving to Jurong Port where we will access the world’s first-of-its-kind shared user facility that comes equipped with its own RMC Port-Centric Eco-system. The RMC Eco-system will be part of a larger construction setup that includes port infrastructure and facilities such as fully enclosed aggregate storage areas and RMC batching plants. Once it is operational, the Jurong Port facility will optimise supply chain efficiencies for building materials while enabling a greener footprint operationally.\\nReinforcing our Sustainability Values on the \\nHealth and Safety of our Employees\\nWe have refreshed our approach on managing \\nthe health and safety of our employees. Safety protocols on traffic management, working-at-height, use of chemicals, working with moving parts of machineries etc. were reviewed and safety policies are cascaded across the organisation. Safety briefings and toolbox meetings were held where employees would share their experiences and discuss opportunities where we can improve our occupational health and safety measures. This is an on-going journey as we work towards achieving our sustainable goal of building resilience for the long term.INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING\\nWe have two main plants in China, one in Dongguan and the other in Tianjin. The plants manufacture rigid packaging products for the industrial and consumer packaging markets. During the year, our operations were impacted by slower demand and higher input costs in resin. Sales dropped to S$25.7 million as compared to S$30.2 million the previous year. A Profit after Tax of S$8.2 million, including a gain from the sale of land and property as mentioned previously was reported in FY2022. \\nPROSPECTS\\nWith China lifting its zero-COVID policy, market demand for medium and heavy-duty diesel engines will gradually improve when older trucks are retired and existing inventory stockpiles cleared. New energy vehicles will do well with local Government supporting their use in the public sector. In Singapore, the Building Materials business should continue to benefit from high construction demand, and the Malaysia market will continue to recover as confidence returns and the credit environment starts to ease. Cost pressures will increase, especially energy and labour costs as the global inflationary environment is here to stay, and interest rates will remain high for some time. With our focus on innovation and productivity enhancements, this will help to mitigate some of the cost concerns. We continue to collaborate with our partners and customers on new energy solutions, and look to bring innovation to the market. \\nWe are cautiously optimistic that our \\nbusinesses will perform satisfactorily in 2023, and will continue to strengthen our operational resilience, remain a reliable partner to our customers and be responsible to our stakeholders and the community. \\nStephen Ho Kiam Kong\\nExecutive Director and Chief Executive Officer24 March 2023\\n各位股东：\\n本人很高兴借呈报集团2022年业绩之时，对集团2022年的运\\n作情况与各位股东做一分享。\\n2022年对集团而言是充满挑战但充实的一年。尽管健康危机\\n旷日持久， 全球供应链持续中断， 通货膨胀不断飙升，但集团各部门和子公司攻坚克难，不仅取得了圆满的业绩也体现了全体员工以及集团业务模式的韧性。\\n在中国出现一波又一波的新冠疫情影响下，中国政府为了严格\\n执行清零政策， 一年内频繁封城，导致集团最大的市场——中国受到冲击。由于国内运输业受到严重影响，卡车和公共汽车商用公路柴油发动机需求严重萎缩，导致行业产品销量下滑逾40%。 2022年2月俄乌战争爆发，让本已脆弱的全球供应链更是雪上加霜，投入成本大幅增加。另外，我们在新加坡和马来西亚的建筑材料业务由于对外来劳工实行严格的入境管制，出现了一定程度的人力短缺。同时，围绕建筑业的工作场所与卫生问题如工业事故以及骨痛溢血热症也拖缓建筑工程进度，  \\n需要一定的时间去改善。\\n受新冠疫情的影响，本集团2022财年的营收为39亿\\n新元(2021 财年： 49亿新元 )， 同比下降21.3%。建筑\\n材料业务在新加坡市场的表现较好。整体上，归属于本公司所有者的净利润（简称“ PATMI ” ）为5,450 万新元 (2021  \\n财年： 6,010万新元） ， 较上年同期下降9.3%。\\n尽管动力传动系统业务销售额下降，但我们在提高价格和降低成本方面所做的努力促进了销售组合的改变，新型国六发动机的利润率逐步提高。在产量开始增加后，利润将有所提升。  \\n集团的动力传动系统业务始终侧重于降低成本、不断创新，  \\n以保持领先地位。\\n新加坡方面，随着建筑领域的项目重新启动，本集团建筑材料\\n业务在成交量和价格方面业绩均有所改善。马来西亚将新冠肺炎定为地方性流行病，助推经济继续强势复苏，但信贷环境持续疲软，加上成本居高不下，影响了集团下游混凝土业务。不过，上游生产和销售水泥熟料业务表现良好。集团将继续集中力量拓展物流产业链，借助一体化模式，进一步提高业务效率。\\n本集团2022财年经营活动产生了3,760 万新元的正\\n现金流净额。\\n在利率大幅上升的情景下，现金流管理、保持财务稳健  \\n对集团而言尤为重要。在这一年，本集团继续剥离非核心资产。2022年第一季度，我们成功出售 Rex Plastics （马来西\\n亚） 旗下占地19,894平方米的一块沉寂已久的永久业权土地和房产。首席执行官 \\n业绩回顾\\n动力传动系统业务\\n玉柴是中国领先的道路用途和非道路用途发动机制造商和经销\\n商，旗下主营子公司为广西玉柴机器有限公司（简称“广西玉柴”或“玉柴”） 。玉柴还参与了针对中国商用车市场的混合动力系统、电池和燃料电池方面的新能源解决方案的开发与销售。\\n玉柴在2022财年的发动机销售量为 321,256台，较上一年的\\n456,791 台， 下降29.7%。主要由于公路卡车和客车市场，特\\n别是中型和重型发动机方面，其需求受到了新冠疫情多点散发\\n和频繁封城的影响。这一年的停电情况大大减少，船用发动机和发电机组的销售量也下降；非道路农用发动机和工业发动机的销售则没有因经济放缓而严重受挫。本集团的新能源汽车业务在这一年的销售量为 6,327 台，而上一年仅为501台，成就\\n虽小但具有重大意义。\\n由于销售量减少，动力传动系统业务的净收入下降26.3%至  \\n33亿新元。2022财年的税后利润为6,700 万新元，较上一年\\n的8,570万新元同比下降21.8%。\\n新能源系统是未来发展关键\\n玉柴致力于对产品提升的研发以及对新能源领域的投入。在2022年，玉柴与合作伙伴及客户联手开发新能源解决方\\n案。2022年3月，玉柴与北京兴顺达成立合资公司，加速燃料电池动力系统及核心燃料电池系统部件的开发、制造和销售， 大力进行北京、天津和河北市场的业务拓展。2022年9月，  \\n玉柴新能源解决方案子公司——玉柴芯蓝新能源动力科技有限公司为南宁公交市场开发出一台3.5吨的电驱动桥并集成到广西申龙的电动轻型客车中。此外，内蒙古铱钼智能科技有限公司采用玉柴芯蓝的300千瓦大功率增程器动力系统，推出其首款国产200公吨智能矿用卡车EM200；该型号既能大幅提升运载效率、也能实现低碳环保智能控制。\\n但我们需要谨记的是，新能源解决方案方面的合作需要一定的\\n时间才能充分发挥成效，它的成功有赖于广泛的基础设施建设和产品的性价比。玉柴着力开发新能源解决方案，这是未来发展的关键，同时也顺应中国政府实现其国家排放目标的计划。\\n建筑材料业务\\n新加坡建筑业在2022年大幅反弹，许多项目重新启动，有助提振集团建筑材料业务。新加坡建设局数据显示，建筑业需求呈现强劲增长趋势，在公共和私人领域住宅和基础设施项目的带动下，建筑需求达至298亿新元。这一轮需求已经转化为对预拌混凝土的利好需求，预计2023年的需求将保持稳定。  \\n马来西亚方面，在连续两年销售额下滑之后，2022年建筑业录得8.8%的涨幅。\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

This has evolved into our core value, “Do the Right Things” where we lead by example to take ownership and accountability of the decisions and actions that impact our businesses and the environment. We believe that conducting our businesses with integrity and driving responsible green practices among our employees is vital towards long-term value creation for our stakeholders.\\nThe Board’s responsibility is to provide clear \\noversight of HLA’s Sustainability Reporting process and risk management of key material issues guided by the recommendations of the Audit and Risk Committee (“ARC”). At HLA, this means ensuring the implementation and frequent review of a strong Corporate Governance system, safeguarding our operations, and supporting the safety and well-being of our employees.\\nWe have developed a holistic Sustainability \\nFramework that helps to guide us in the management of pertinent Environment, Social and Governance (“ESG”) issues. We are pleased to report on the progress of our short-term ESG targets that is in line with the Group’s 2025 Vision.\\nPushing Ahead on our Sustainability \\nFramework\\nIn 2022, we remained focused on driving the \\nprogress of our key ESG targets under the three interconnected pillars of our Sustainability Framework, “Driving Innovation for a Low-\\nMr Wang Jun, Head of GYMCL Advanced Technology Research Centre, receiving the UN R49.07 Euro VI E \\nEmission certification from TÜV Rheinland.\\nCarbon and Circular Economy”, “Empowering \\nour People and Communities” and “Building \\nResilience for the Long-Term”, firstly, through consistent communication we will expand upon key messages surrounding our ESG ambitions and secondly, we are committed to ensure action is being driven at the ground level.\\nThe key narratives across these three pillars \\nwithin our core focus in the built environment and transportation sectors will continuously develop as their regulatory environment and industry trends evolve. Hence, we have set the tone from the top during quarterly town hall meetings by emphasising on the importance of our ESG targets as well as sharing key success stories from various businesses. We are also engaging the leadership team to expand the focus towards key trends that impact our business activities and the value chain which typically covers product innovation, operational efficiency, circular economy and digital solutions. This is done via sharing sessions during our monthly management meetings, town hall meetings, training sessions and other employee programmes where we discuss how these various topics could impact our businesses. \\nWe are also embarking on a new journey \\nto drive bottom-up action. This has been led by the formation of two “ESG Impact Working Groups” within the Building Materials business in Singapore and Malaysia consisting of management level members tasked to oversee the strategies and progress of their respective ESG targets. As for our Powertrain Solutions business in China, we collaborated with the various departments to develop and incorporate the unit’s ESG targets under our Sustainability Framework and this completes our Group’s 2025 commitments as seen in our 2022 Sustainability Report.\\nTo further strengthen and provide clarity on \\nthese commitments, the Human Resources team has also put plans in place to progressively embed our ESG targets within the roles and responsibilities of employees throughout the organisation. We target to implement Key Performance Indicators linked to our 2025 ESG targets under the Group’s Performance Progress Cycle for employees in 2023.\\nUrbanisation Trend Remains Intact \\nThe urbanisation of cities remain front and centre of our lives – today, we see a much higher interest and activity towards improving the experience of city dwellers in communities and spaces. Moreover, such activity that occurs on the ground and national level are increasingly being linked with climate change effects. Hence, suitable long-term solutions to improve the implementation of urban structures and design to cope with climate change are being sought after. In the region of Asia where we operate, this is a complex area to navigate as we deal with local regulatory frameworks and design requirements. Nonetheless, there are clear opportunities to pursue as we see governments, authorities and commercial players express interests to collaborate and develop solutions at an even faster pace than before. \\nDriving Partnerships to Develop Better \\nMobility Solutions\\nIn China, value-chain players in the automotive \\nand transport sector are collaborating on new energy technologies, fuel efficiency and infrastructure development in the key regions. Yuchai has continued its efforts to develop new energy solutions by teaming up with partners and customers. This includes a joint venture formed with bus manufacturer, Beijing Xingshunda, to accelerate the development of fuel cell powertrain systems as well as core fuel cell power system components for the Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei markets. Furthermore, the Group recently formed a new energy solutions subsidiary, Yuchai Xin-Lan New Energy and has successfully integrated a 3.5 tonne electric drive axle into an EV light-duty bus manufactured by Guangxi Shenlong for the Nanning bus market. Moving forward, this subsidiary will be developing new partnerships to strengthen its research and development processes, strategic testing locations for trials and talent recruitment strategies.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

       " Document(metadata={'source': './Hong Leong Annual Report 2022.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='Preparing for the Next Wave of Green \\nBuilding Demands\\nOver in Singapore, the case for green \\nbuildings continues to hold strong and we remain focused on aligning our initiatives with the country’s target to green 80% of buildings (by floor area) by 2030 and accelerate decarbonisation across building lifecycle under the Singapore Green Building Masterplan*. The key improvement tracks identified include raising building energy performance standards, better designs for maintenance, designing a healthier environment for users and reducing embodied carbon. In addressing the area on embodied carbon, we continue to develop our portfolio of green ready-mix concrete under Island Concrete of our Building Materials business to meet the needs of our customers as the criteria for green building materials becomes more stringent. The Singapore government also continues to push ahead to improve construction productivity and strengthen the resilience of the built industry against supply chain and manpower disruptions with the adoption of Design for Manufacturing and Assembly technologies. Our Building Materials business reached a major milestone in December 2022 when we obtained temporary occupation permit for our long-awaited Integrated Construction and Prefabricated Hub (“ICPH”) located in Pulau Punggol Barat. This is a state-of-the-art facility set up to manufacture Advanced Precast Concrete System and Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction products using simplified processes. The facility has also been designed to incorporate a higher level of automation and controlled factory environment to reduce both environmental impact and labour-intensive construction work. \\nIn Malaysia, there is similar interest in the Green \\nBuilding movement, to implement energy efficiency and green product solutions for new built environment projects. We continue to focus on developing our portfolio of green building material products under Tasek in \\n* https:/ /www1.bca.gov.sg/buildsg/sustainability/green-building-masterplans\\nMalaysia. We see growing trends in the area of \\nimproving industrial processes which require circular economy and commercial energy efficiency solutions. In the past year, we have been successful in increasing volumes of alternative raw materials in our cement products. As to alternative fuels, we have increased our volumes slightly and remained focused on reaching our 2025 ESG targets to progressively reduce our dependency on coal usage to power our operations. We continue to review investments to improve the operational efficiency and productivity of our cement plant located in Ipoh, Malaysia.\\nClimate Change and our Green Transition \\nIn line with our goals to drive more ambitious targets beyond 2025 under our sustainability pillar, “Driving Innovation for a Low-Carbon and Circular Economy”, we took the first step to internally address and align on the potential implications of climate change for our organisation. This was carried out in alignment with the SGX mandate for all issuers to adopt climate reporting in phases based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). HLA being in the materials and buildings and transportation sectors is required to fulfil this requirement from financial year 2024. In 2022, with the help of a consultant, we developed our TCFD reporting framework and drafted our first-year disclosures starting from FY2022. We developed our climate risk assessment based on two scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change pathways, 1.5°C (RCP 2.6) and >3°C (RCP 8.5), with 2019 adopted as the baseline year. Considered over short, medium and long-term (2030, 2050, 2080) horizons, it was identified that our assets are not vulnerable to physical risks in the short term but would likely be affected by transition risks such as carbon pricing, changing customer needs and stringent industry regulations. Both risks are likely to increase over the medium- and long-term. The transition risks are being addressed by the Group through its existing business strategy and moving forward, we are set to reduce carbon emissions in our sectors. We will continue to build our experience over time in climate-related financial reporting. For the full narrative on our TCFD disclosures, please see our 2022 Sustainability Report.\\nSteady Steps Towards Safety Leadership\\nAs of 19 September 2022, following a high occurrence of workplace fatalities, the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) launched a code of practice in essence to strengthen the workplace safety culture under the Workplace Safety and Health (“WSH”) Act 2006. There are clear guidelines and principles under the WSH Act for organisations to adopt as their framework. To align on and strengthen our understanding of the recent updates to the WSH Act, an Occupational Health and Safety training was conducted for the Board and Management Team (Corporate Office) on 13 March 2023. In line with our ESG targets for zero fatalities and Loss Time Injuries (“LTIs”), we remain committed to improve our safety performance over the long term.\\nStrict legislation with MOM driving at the \\nnational level sets a strong tone from the very top and offers clear guiding frameworks for organisations to follow suit. However, to sustain and continuously promote healthy attitudes towards safety, we believe that organisations should embed such principles as their core values. Under our third pillar, “Building Resilience for the Long term”, we continue to practise the principles that the safety of our people require tough leadership, vigilant management of our workplace environments and effective communication.

All issuance of the Company’s financial results require the approval of the Board, including decisions on the Company’s dividend policy and payouts. Management is fully apprised of such matters which require the approval of the Board or the Board Committees.\\nDelegation by the Board (Provision 1.4)\\nThe primary functions of the Board are either carried out directly by the Board or through the Board Committees with clear written terms of reference setting out their composition, authority and responsibilities, including reporting back to the Board. The committees established by the Board are the ARC, the NC, the RC, and the SOSC, all collectively referred to as the “Board Committees”.\\nSpecific written terms of reference for each of these Board Committees set out the required \\ncomposition, authority and responsibilities of the Board Committees and provide for each Board Committee to submit at least an annual report of its activities to the Board. All terms of reference for the Board Committees are approved by the Board and reviewed periodically to ensure their continued relevance taking into consideration the changes in the governance and regulatory environment.Accountability of the Board and Management (Provision 1.1)The Board and Management are committed to conducting business with integrity and consistent with high standards of business ethics, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulatory requirements. The Company has established various corporate policies as necessary which provide a communicable and understandable framework for employees to observe the Company’s principles on honesty, integrity, responsibility and accountability at all levels of the organisation and in the conduct of the Company’s business in their relationships with the Company’s stakeholders, including customers, suppliers and employees. Further details of these policies are described in the segment entitled ‘Corporate Values and Conduct of Business’ at the end of this report.\\nBoard Orientation and Training (Provision 1.2)\\nEvery newly appointed Director receives a formal letter, setting out his or her general duties and obligations as a Director pursuant to the relevant legislation and regulations. The new Director will also receive an induction pack containing information and documents relating to the role, duties and responsibilities of a director and a member of the Board Committees, the Group’s principal businesses, the Company’s Board processes, corporate governance practices, relevant company policies and procedures as well as a Board and the Board Committees meeting calendar for the year with a brief of the routine agenda for each meeting.\\nThe Company also conducts a comprehensive induction programme for newly appointed Directors \\nand for existing Directors pursuant to their appointments to any of the Board Committees, which seeks to familiarise Directors with the Group’s principal businesses, the Company’s Board processes, internal controls and governance practices, and in the case of appointments to any of the Board Committees, the role and areas of responsibilities of such Board Committees. The induction programme includes meetings with various key executives of the Management to allow the new Directors to be acquainted with the Management and to facilitate their independent access to the Management in future. The programme also includes site visits to the Group’s key operations and briefings by the Management on key areas of the Group’s operations.\\nFor a first time Director who has no prior experience as a director of a listed company, in addition to \\nthe induction as detailed above, he or she will be required to also attend certain specific modules of the Listed Entity Director (“LED”) Programme conducted by the Singapore Institute of Directors (“SID”) in order to acquire relevant knowledge of what is expected of a listed company director, this being a mandatory requirement under the Listing Manual. Completion of the LED Programme, which focuses on comprehensive training of company directors on compliance, regulatory and corporate governance matters, should provide the first time Director with a broad understanding of the roles and responsibilities of a director of a listed company under the requirements of the Companies Act 1967, the Listing Manual and the 2018 Code.\\nThe Directors are also provided with updates and/or briefings from time to time by professional \\nadvisers, auditors, Management and the Company Secretaries in areas such as directors’ duties and responsibilities, corporate governance practices, relevant legislations and regulations, risk management and financial reporting standards. The Directors are regularly kept informed by the Company Secretaries of the availability of appropriate courses, conferences and seminars such as those conducted by the SID, and the Directors are encouraged to attend such trainings at the Company’s expense. The NC and the Board are kept informed of the trainings attended by the Directors during the year. As part of the NC’s annual assessment of the skill set of the Board and the Board Committees, the NC would also recommend further training for the Directors in specific areas, if so required, to supplement the regular updates/briefings provided to the Directors from time to time.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

The 2022 AGM was held via electronic means.\\nDirectors’ Multiple Board Representations and Time Commitments (Provision 1.5)\\nWhen considering the nomination of Directors for election/re-election, the NC also takes into account the competing time commitments faced by Directors with multiple listed company board representations and/or other principal commitments. An analysis of the directorships (which includes directorships within corporate groups and executive appointments) held by the Directors is reviewed annually by the NC. Each Director is also required to confirm annually to the NC as to whether he or she has any issue with competing time commitments which may impact his or her ability to provide sufficient time and attention to his or her duties as a Director of the Company. Based on the analysis, the Directors’ annual confirmation and the Directors’ commitments and contributions to the Company which are also evident in their level of attendance and participation at Board and Board Committees’ meetings, the NC is satisfied that all Directors are able to carry out and have been adequately carrying out their duties as Directors of the Company.\\nThe NC noted that, excluding the directorship held In the Company, the number of listed company \\nboard representations currently held by:\\n– Mr Tan Chian Khong, the only ID who holds other listed company board representations, is \\nfour, and\\n– each ED, Mr Kwek Leng Peck and Mr Stephen Ho, did not exceed two, all being representations \\non the boards of related corporations of the Company including a listed subsidiary and/or a listed associated company of the Group.The delegation of authority by the Board to the Board Committees enables the Board to achieve operational efficiency by empowering these Board Committees to decide, review and make recommendations on matters within their respective written terms of reference and/or limits of delegated authority, and yet without abdicating the Board’s overall responsibility.\\nPlease refer to the sections on Principles 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 in this report for further information \\non the activities of the ARC, NC and RC. Information on the activities of the SOSC is set out in the Directors’ Statement on pages 77 to 80 and the Financial Statements on pages 185 to 188 of this AR.\\nBoard and Board Committee Meetings (Provision 1.5)\\nMeetings of the Board and Board Committees are held regularly, with the Board meetings no less than four times a year. At the regular quarterly Board meetings, the agenda includes updates by the Management on the performance and operations of each business unit of the Group, and the Group’s periodic financial performance. Four Board meetings were held in 2022. \\nA meeting of the non-executive Directors (“NEDs”) who are all also the IDs of the Company, \\nchaired by the Lead ID, was held in 2022 without the presence of Management. Meetings of the \\nIDs are convened as often as may be warranted by circumstances. The IDs also meet regularly under the various Board Committees’ meetings and the Lead ID is a member of all these Board Committees.\\nThe proposed meetings for the Board and all Board Committees for each new calendar year are \\nset out in a schedule of meetings and notified to all Board members before the start of that calendar year. Additional meetings are convened as and when circumstances warrant. Records of all such meetings including key deliberations and decisions taken are maintained by the Company Secretaries. The Company’s Constitution allows for the meetings of its Board and the Board Committees to be held via teleconferencing and video-conferencing. The Board and Board Committees may also make decisions by way of circulating written resolutions.\\nThe attendance (including via electronic means) of the Directors at the annual general meeting \\nof the Company (“AGM ”) and meetings of the Board and the Board Committees as well as the \\nfrequency of such meetings in 2022, are disclosed on page 41. Nonetheless, the Board is of the view that the contribution of each Director should not be focused solely on his or her attendance at the AGM and at meetings of the Board and/or the Board Committees. A Director’s contribution also extends beyond the confines of the formal environment of such meetings, through the sharing of views, advice, experience and strategic networking relationships which would further the interests of the Group. The Directors also, whether individually or collectively, engage with the Management to better understand the challenges faced by the Group and the inputs of the Directors, through such engagement, provide valuable perspective to the Management.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

To facilitate this access, all Directors are provided with the contact details of the KMP and other members of the Management.\\nThe Directors, whether as a group or individually, are entitled to take independent professional \\nadvice at the expense of the Company, in furtherance of their duties and in the event that circumstances warrant the same. The Company has in place internal guidelines allowing the Directors to seek independent professional advice.\\nThe Company Secretaries’ appointment and removal are subject to the Board’s approval. At least \\none of the Company Secretaries attends all Board and Board Committee meetings and ensures that all Board procedures are followed. The Company Secretaries, together with Management, also ensure that the Company complies with applicable statutory and regulatory rules. Together with Management, the Company Secretaries also advise the Board Chairman, the Board and the Board Committees on corporate governance matters and assist to implement and strengthen corporate governance practices and processes, including ensuring adequate and timely information flows within the Board and the Board Committees and between the Directors and Management, facilitating the induction for newly appointed Directors and newly appointed Board Committee members, and assisting in the continuing training and development programmes for the Directors. On an on-going basis, the Directors have separate and independent access to the Company Secretaries.\\nPRINCIPLE 2: BOARD COMPOSITION AND GUIDANCE\\nBoard Independence (Provisions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3)\\nThe Board currently comprises five members, two of whom are executive Directors, while the other three members of the Board are NEDs. The NC has determined all three NEDs, being more than half of the Board, to be independent (“3 IDs”), thus providing for a strong and independent element on the Board, capable of exercising objective judgement on the corporate affairs of the Company. No individual or small group of individuals dominates the Board’s decision-making. No alternate Directors have been appointed in respect of any of the Directors.\\nWhen reviewing the independence of the 3 IDs, namely, Ms Caroline Kwong, Mr Ng Sey Ming \\nand Mr Tan Chian Khong, the NC has considered the applicable Rule 210(5)(d) of the Listing Manual and the guidelines for independence set out in Provision 2.1 of the 2018 Code and its accompanying Practice Guidance. As part of the consideration of their independence, the NC has also taken into account the following:\\n• other directorships; \\n• annual declarations regarding their independence;\\n• disclosures of interests in transactions in which they have a direct/indirect interest (if any);\\n• their ability to avoid any apparent conflict of interest especially by abstaining from deliberation \\nand decision-making on such transactions; \\n• their ability to maintain objectivity in their conduct as Directors of the Company; and\\n• their ability to objectively raise issues and seek clarification as and when necessary from the \\nBoard, Management and the Company’s external advisers on matters pertaining to their area of \\nresponsibilities whether on the Board or on the Board Committees. \\nEach of the IDs on the NC recused himself or herself from discussion and abstained from the NC’s \\ndeliberation on his or her own independence.On the NC’s recommendation, the Board has approved that the maximum number of listed company board representations which a Director of the Company may hold be set at six, with a view to providing a guide to address potential competing time commitments that may be faced by Directors serving on multiple listed company boards. The NC may review this guideline from time to time, and will also consider the circumstances of individual Directors or potential candidates with multiple listed company directorships above the recommended number to determine their capacity to participate and contribute effectively to the Board. \\nIn addition to the current procedures for the review of the attendance records and analysis of \\ndirectorships/principal commitments, a policy has also been put in place for Directors to consult the Board Chairman and the chairman of the NC prior to accepting any new listed company board appointments or principal commitments and notifying the Board of any changes in their external appointments. This would allow the Director to review his or her time commitments with the proposed new appointment and in the case of an ID, to also ensure that his or her independence would not be affected.\\nComplete, Adequate and Timely Information (Provision 1.6)\\nPrior to each meeting, members of the Board and the Board Committees are provided with the meeting agenda and the relevant papers submitted by Management, containing where possible and practicable, complete, adequate and timely information such as reports on the operations and financial performances of the various business units respectively, reports from the corporate risk committee, Sustainability Committee, internal auditors (“IA”) and external auditors (“EA”), regulatory updates, and/or significant projects/events updates, to enable full deliberation on the issues to be considered at the respective meetings.\\nManagement also provides all Directors with monthly financial reports of the Group’s financial \\nperformance including analysis of the same. Any material variances between the results and the budget and year-on-year for the periods under review are explained in the monthly financial reports. Where the Board’s or a Board Committee’s approval is sought, relevant background and explanatory information on the specific matter is provided to enable Directors to understand the issues and to request for further information, as necessary.\\nManagement, the Company’s external auditors and professional advisers who can provide \\nadditional insight into the matters for discussion are also invited from time to time to attend Board and/or Board Committees’ meetings. \\nDraft agendas for Board and Board Committee meetings are circulated to the Board Chairman and \\nthe chairmen of the Board Committees respectively, in advance, for them to review and suggest items for the agenda. The Board and the Board Committees are also furnished with routine reports, where applicable, from the various departments of the Company. Each of the chairmen of the ARC, NC, RC and SOSC provides an annual report of the respective committees’ activities during the year under review to the Board. The minutes of meetings of the Board Committees and the NEDs/IDs are circulated to all Board members.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD. ANNUAL REPORT 202242\\nRELIABLE • RESILIENT • RESPONSIBLE 43'),\n",

If Datuk Maimoonah’s appointment is approved, she will also be appointed as a member of the ARC after the conclusion of the 2023 AGM.  \\nMs Kwek has been the Head of Sustainability and Corporate Affairs of the \\nCompany since January 2020. She oversees the Group’s strategic direction in its management of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, sustainability reporting framework and corporate communication. Datuk Maimoonah is an accomplished banker with over 40 years of experience specialising in debt capital markets, structured finance, securities, asset management and investment banking. She had worked with leading global financial and banking institutions until her retirement in November 2019. Please refer to the ‘Board of Directors’ and ‘Additional Information \\non Directors Seeking Re-election/Appointment’ sections in this AR for \\nmore information on these proposed Directors.\\nEnsuring gender diversity on the Board with not less than 20% female representation on the BoardWith Ms Caroline Kwong as a Director of the Company, the Board has continued to achieve its target of 20% female representation as recommended by the Council for Board Diversity (“CBD”) for listed companies. \\nThe NC noted that the CBD has recommended for listed companies to \\nhave 25% female representation on their boards by 2025 and 30% by 2030. With the proposed appointments of Ms Kwek and Datuk Maimoonah, the \\nCompany will achieve a 42% female board representation, exceeding its gender diversity target and CBD’s targets.\\nNonetheless,  the NC will ensure that:\\n(a) if external search consultants are used to search for candidates for \\nBoard appointments, the brief will include a requirement to present \\nfemale candidates;\\n(b) when seeking to identify a new Director for appointment to the Board, \\nthe NC will request for female candidates to be fielded for consideration;\\n(c) female representation on the Board be continually monitored over \\ntime based on the set targets of the Board; and\\n(d) at least one female Director be appointed to the NC.\\nMaintain age diversity with Directors with age ranging from below 50s to below 70s with majority of the Directors in the 60 to 70 rangeThe Board has continued to maintain this target.None of the 3 IDs is currently employed or has been employed at any time during the past three financial years by the Company or any of its related corporations. These 3 IDs also do not have immediate family members who are currently employed or have been employed at any time during the past three financial years by the Company or any of its related corporations, and whose remuneration is determined by the RC. For purposes of determining independence, the 3 IDs have also provided confirmation that they are not related to the Directors and substantial shareholders of the Company. The NC is satisfied that there is no other relationship which could affect their independence. The Board undertook a review of the independence of the 3 IDs with each ID abstaining from participating in his or her own review, and the Board concurred with the NC’s determination of the independence of the 3 IDs. \\nMr Ng Sey Ming, an ID, is a partner of legal firms, Messrs Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP (“R&T ”) and \\nMessrs Christopher & Lee Ong (“CLO ”) (with less than 5% stake in each of them) which rendered \\nprofessional legal services to the Group from time to time. The total amount of the fees paid/to be \\npaid to R&T and CLO for FY 2022 was less than $200,000, which was largely for the legal services rendered by R&T and CLO to the Group. Mr Ng had abstained from the deliberation and decision-making in the engagement of R&T and CLO as solicitors for transactions relating to these legal services. The NC has determined, and the Board has concurred, that Mr Ng’s independence is not affected by this relationship of the Group with R&T and CLO.\\nThe 3 IDs had also avoided apparent conflicts of interests especially by abstaining from deliberation \\non transactions in which they had a direct/indirect interest, and were able to maintain objectivity in their conduct as Directors of the Company. They have objectively raised issues and sought clarification as and when necessary from the Board, Management and the Group’s external advisers on matters pertaining to their area of responsibilities whether on the Board or on the Board Committees.\\nBoard Composition, Size and Diversity (Provision 2.4)\\nThe Company has in place a Board Diversity Policy (“BDP”) which sets out the framework for promoting diversity on the Board. The Company recognises that a diverse Board is an important element which will better support the Company’s achievement of its strategic objectives for sustainable development by enhancing the decision-making process of the Board through the perspectives derived from the various skills, business experience, industry discipline and other aspects of diversity (such as gender and age) of the Directors.\\nThe BDP which is available on the Company’s corporate website, provides that the NC shall consider \\nall aspects of diversity when reviewing and assessing the composition of the Board and when making recommendations to the Board for the appointment of Directors to arrive at an optimal balanced composition of the Board. The BDP also provides for the NC to discuss and recommend annually to the Board targets and timelines for promoting and achieving diversity on the Board. \\nThe Company has put in place a skills matrix to help identify gaps in the Board.  The skills matrix \\nclassifies skills, experience and knowledge of the existing Directors into broad categories such as industry knowledge; management expertise; and professional skills in finance/accounting, risk management, legal, sustainability, corporate finance/mergers and acquisitions, digital/technology and human resources. \\nWhen reviewing and assessing the size and composition of the Board and the Board Committees, \\nand making recommendations to the Board annually including the election/re-election of Directors, the NC takes into consideration factors under the BDP with a view to arriving at an optimal balanced composition of the Board and Board Committees.

The Board is of the view that Mr Kwek’s role as an executive Board Chairman would continue to facilitate the Group’s decision-making and implementation process without diminishing the capacity of the Board for independent decision-making.\\nLead Independent Director (Provision 3.3)\\nIn view that the Board Chairman is not an ID, the Board has appointed Mr Tan Chian Khong as Lead ID to serve as a sounding board for the Board Chairman and as an intermediary between the NEDs and the Board Chairman.

The Lead ID is available to shareholders should they have concerns and for which contact through the normal communication channels with the Board Chairman or the Management has failed to resolve or are inappropriate or inadequate.

The Company Secretaries maintain records of all NC meetings including records of key deliberations and decisions taken.The NC and the Board also agreed that there was no need to set a specific target for ethnicity/nationality so long as the candidates provide distinguishing qualities that complement and expand the skills and experience of the Board as a whole. Further information on the individual Directors’ background, experience and skills can be found in the ‘Board of Directors’ section in this AR.  \\nHaving considered the scope and nature of the operations of the Group, the Board, taking into \\naccount the view of the NC, believes that the size and composition of the Board and Board Committees (including the proposed appointments of Ms Kwek and Datuk Maimoonah) provide for diversity in line with the BDP and allow for informed and constructive discussions and effective decision-making at meetings of the Board and Board Committees.\\nNEDs’ Participation (Provision 2.5)\\nNEDs are encouraged to participate actively at Board meetings in the development of the Group’s strategic plans and direction, and in the review and monitoring of Management’s performance against budgets. To facilitate this, they are kept informed of the Group’s businesses and performance through monthly and quarterly reports from Management, and have unrestricted access to Management. They also sit on various Board Committees to provide unbiased and independent views, constructive input and the independent review and monitoring of performance of the Group and Management.\\nUnder the chairmanship of the Lead ID, a meeting of the NEDs who are all also the IDs of the \\nCompany, was convened in 2022 without the presence of Management and the Board Chairman. The NEDs would also confer among themselves without the presence of Management as and when the need arises. The Lead ID collates the feedback from the NEDs and communicates the same to the Board and/or the Board Chairman as appropria te.\\nPRINCIPLE 3: CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (“CEO”)\\nRoles of Chairman and the CEO (Provisions 3.1 and 3.2)\\nThe roles of Chairman of the Board and the CEO are separate to ensure a clear division of responsibilities and increased accountability.\\nMr Kwek Leng Peck, the Executive Chairman of the Board (“Board Chairman”), plays an instrumental \\nrole in providing the Company with strong leadership and vision, assisting the Board to develop policies and strategies, and ensuring that these are implemented effectively. The Board sets out clear division of his responsibilities as the Board Chairman.

The Company has currently identified its Board Chairman and the CEO as its KMP. On an annual basis, the RC reviews and recommends fees payable to the Directors for the Board’s consideration before approval is sought from the shareholders at the AGM. The RC also reviews and recommends annually the specific remuneration packages for the Directors and the KMP including the annual increments, mid-year and year-end variable bonuses, special bonus, if any, and share options for the KMP for the Board’s approval. The RC also considers the KMP’s contracts of service to ensure that they do not contain any unfair or unreasonable termination clauses.\\nThe RC has access to appropriate advice from the Head of HR, who attends all RC and SOSC \\nmeetings. There being no specific necessity, the RC did not seek expert advice from external remuneration consultants in 2022.\\nThe Company Secretaries maintain records of all RC and SOSC meetings including records of key \\ndeliberations and decisions taken. Two meetings of the RC and a meeting of SOSC were convened during 2022.Board Development (Provision 4.5)The NC reviews the training and development of the Directors to ensure that Directors receive appropriate development on a continuing basis, to perform their roles on the Board and where applicable, the Board Committees. The Directors are provided with updates and/or briefings to assist them to properly discharge their duties. The briefings are conducted either internally with invited speakers, or externally, at the Company’s expense. Further trainings for the Directors in specific areas are also being recommended by the NC, where required, based on the NC’s review of the annual evaluation checklists from the Board and the Board Committees. A separate programme is established for new Directors, details of which are set out in the relevant paragraph under the subject heading “Board Orientation and Training” above.\\nThe Board is kept apprised twice yearly on the list of training programmes attended by the \\nDirectors during the year .\\nPRINCIPLE 5: BOARD PERFORMANCE\\nBoard Evaluation Process (Provision 5.1)\\nThe Company has in place a formal process for assessment of the effectiveness of the Board as a whole, the various Board Committees and the contribution by each Director to the effectiveness of the Board and the Board Committees, where applicable. No external facilitator has been used. The NC assesses the Board’s performance as a whole annually using objective and appropriate criteria which were recommended by the NC and approved by the Board. When assessing the overall Board performance, the NC takes into consideration the Board composition, the Directors’ independence, the feedback from individual Directors on areas relating to the Board’s role on strategy and performance, the Board’s process and governance (including oversight on risk management and internal controls) and the effectiveness of the Board Chairman. The results of the overall evaluation of the Board by the NC including its recommendations for improvements, if any, are presented to the Board.\\nThe NC also undertook an evaluation of the performance of the Board Committees, specifically \\nthe NC, the RC and the ARC with the assistance of self-assessment checklists completed by these Board Committees as well as a report provided by the chairman of the SOSC.\\nBoard Evaluation Criteria (Provision 5.2)\\nThe qualitative criteria used by the NC to evaluate the Board cover five key areas relating to Board structure, the Board’s review of the Company’s strategy and performance, the Board’s oversight on the Company’s governance including risk management and internal controls, and the effectiveness of the Board Chairman and Board processes.\\nThe quantitative criteria used to evaluate the overall Board performance comprise periodic \\nperformance indicators which include a comparison of the Group’s performance (including segmental performance) for the financial period under review against the Group’s performance for the corresponding period in preceding year and the budget, and also other indicators such as the Company’s share price performance over a historical period.\\nIndividual Director Evaluation (Provisions 5.1 and 5.2)\\nThe annual evaluation process for the Board Chairman’s and the individual Director’s performance comprises two parts: (a) review of background information concerning the Director including his or her attendance record at Board and Board Committee meetings; and (b) NC’s evaluation based on certain assessment parameters, which were recommended by the NC and approved by the Board.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

KMP who have \\na greater ability to influence the Group’s outcomes have a greater proportion of overall reward at risk. It is put in place to increase the Group’s flexibility and effectiveness in its continuing efforts to reward, retain and motivate key good employees to achieve superior performance and to motivate them to continue to strive for the Group’s long-term shareholder value. It also aims to strengthen the Group’s competitiveness in attracting and retaining talented key management employees. The Company does not require the KMP to continue to hold their shares upon exercise of the options after the vesting period. Options granted under the SOS to the KMP vest progressively over a period of three years. To-date, the Company has granted only Market Price Options and Incentive Price Options (both as defined in the SOS). Information on the SOS is set out in the Directors’ Statement on pages 77 to 80 and the Financial Statements on pages 185 to 188 of this AR.\\nThe SOS was first approved by the shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting in 2000 for an \\ninitial period of ten years commencing on 30 December 2000. It was extended at the AGM in April 2010 for a further period of ten years from 30 December 2010 to 29 December 2020. At the AGM held in June 2020, the shareholders approved the second extension of the duration of the SOS for another period of ten years from 30 December 2020 to 29 December 2030.\\nThe Company does not discourage Directors from holding shares in the Company. There is \\nhowever no requirement under the Company’s Constitution for Directors to hold shares in order to be qualified to act as a Director. The NEDs are eligible to participate in the SOS. The grant of options under the SOS to the NEDs is subject to the SOSC’s recommendation and the Board’s endorsement. \\nThe letter of offer of options to eligible participants (including KMP) under the SOS includes a \\nclaw-back provision which gives the Company the right to recover or cancel the options (whether in whole or in part, before they are exercised) in the event of exceptional circumstances involving a misstatement of the financial results of the Company and the Group for the financial year on which the grant is based, or any misconduct by an employee of the Company, resulting in financial loss to the Group.\\nWhen reviewing the structure and level of Directors’ fees, which comprise base director’s fee and \\nadditional fees for services rendered under the various Board Committees and fee for the Lead ID, the RC takes into consideration the Directors’ respective roles and responsibilities in the Board and Board Committees and the changes in the business, corporate governance practices and regulatory rules. The RC also compared the Company’s fee structure against industry practices. Other factors taken into consideration in the fee review includes the frequency of Board and Board Committee meetings, corporate performance for the financial year under review as well as the corporate and economic outlook in the new financial year, and the interval since the last fee review and changes. The RC is mindful that the remuneration for IDs should not be excessive so as to compromise or reasonably be perceived to compromise their independence. No Director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.\\nEach of the Directors receives a base Director’s fee, with the Board Chairman receiving an additional \\nfee for serving as the chairman. The Lead ID also receives an additional fee to reflect his expanded responsibility. Directors who serve on the various Board Committees (other than the SOSC) also receive additional fees in respect of each Board Committee that they serve on, with the chairmen of the Board Committees receiving a higher fee in respect of their service as chairman of the respective committees. For the financial year under review, the RC conducted a self-assessment of its own effectiveness in the discharge of its roles and responsibilities, which was facilitated through the use of a self-assessment checklist (“RC Self-Assessment Checklist”). The RC Self-Assessment Checklist covered, inter alia, the responsibilities of the RC under its terms of reference, and considered also \\nthe contribution of RC members to the deliberation and decision-making process at RC meetings.\\nBased on the self-assessment, the RC believes that it has fulfilled its responsibilities and discharged \\nits duties as set out in its terms of reference.\\nPRINCIPLE 7: LEVEL AND MIX OF REMUNERATION\\nRemuneration of Directors and KMP (Provisions 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3)\\nThe Company’s remuneration policy for Directors comprises the following distinct objectives:\\n• to ensure that the procedure for determining remuneration for Directors is formal and \\ntransparent;\\n• to ensure that the level of remuneration is sufficient (without being excessive) to attract and \\nretain Directors to exercise oversight responsibility over the Company; and\\n• to ensure that no Director is involved in deciding on his or her own remuneration.\\nIn reviewing the remuneration packages of the KMP, the RC, with the assistance of the Head of HR, considers the level of remuneration based on the Company’s remuneration policy which comprises the following three distinct objectives:\\n• to ensure that the remuneration packages are competitive in attracting and retaining \\nemployees capable of meeting the Company’s needs;\\n• to reward employees for achieving corporate and individual performance targets in a fair and \\nequitable way; and\\n• to ensure that the remuneration reflects employees’ duties and responsibilities.\\nThe Company advocates a performance-based remuneration system that is flexible and responsive to the market, and the performance of the Group’s business units and individual employees. In designing the compensation structure, the Company seeks to ensure that the level and mix of remuneration are competitive, relevant and appropriate in finding a balance between the current and longer-term objectives of the Company.\\nBased on the remuneration framework, the remuneration packages for the KMP comprise a \\nfixed component (in the form of a base salary, annual wage supplement, and where applicable fixed allowances determined by the Company’s human resource policies), a variable component (comprising short-term incentives in the form of mid-year and year-end variable bonuses, special bonus and long-term incentives in the form of the grant of share options subject to a vesting schedule) and benefits-in-kind, where applicable. The variable components take into account amongst other factors, the KMP’s individual performance, the Group’s performance, the business unit’s performance and industry practices. The Company exercises broad discretion and independent judgement in ensuring that the amount and mix of compensation are aligned with the interests of shareholders and promote the long-term success of the Company.\\nThe mix of fix and variable reward is considered appropriate for the Group and for each individual \\nrole. The overall level of remuneration is not considered to be at a level which is likely to promote behaviour contrary to the Group’s risk profile. The compensation structure is directly linked to corporate and individual performance, both in terms of financial, non-financial performance and the creation of shareholder wealth.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

Risk management activities are aligned to the Group’s strategic objectives and priorities while protecting the interests of the Board and shareholders.\\nAn Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) framework has been established by Management to \\nformalise and document the internal processes to enable significant strategic, financial, operational, compliance and IT risks within the relevant Group companies to be identified, assessed, monitored, managed and evaluated. The Board determines the Group’s levels of risk tolerance and risk policies, and oversees management in the design, implementation and monitoring of the risk management and internal control systems. Strong emphasis is placed on creating risk awareness, promoting accountability and setting the appropriate tone at the top. Risk management training is conducted to communicate and enhance the Group’s risk culture.\\nA risk management oversight and reporting structure has been established to enable the \\nManagement to effectively carry out their roles and responsibilities under the ERM framework. The risk committees (consisting of cross functional personnel), at both corporate and business unit levels, implement and maintain risk management policies and initiatives across the Group. The risk management processes at the key business units are driven by their respective risk committees, with regular reporting to the corporate risk committee (comprising members of the Management and headed by the CEO), who in turn reports to the ARC. The key steps in the risk management process are risk identification, risk assessment, risk treatment and risk monitoring. On an ongoing basis, Management reviews the Group’s business operations to identify key risk areas and risk mitigating strategies so as to ensure that risks are adequately managed within the Group’s risk tolerance limits. \\nReports on risk management issues are presented by the ERM Manager to the ARC on a regular \\nbasis.

Besides Mr Tan, none of the remaining ARC members were former partners or directors of or have any financial interest in the Company’s existing EA. Please refer to the ‘Board of Directors’ section in this AR for the academic/professional qualification and experience of the members of the ARC.\\nWith the current composition, the ARC believes that it has the relevant accounting or related \\nfinancial management expertise and experience to discharge its functions within its written terms of reference which has been approved by the Board.\\nPowers and Duties of the ARC (Provisions 10.1 and 10.5)\\nThe ARC is authorised by the Board to review or investigate any matters it deems appropriate within its terms of reference and has direct and unrestricted access to the EA, the IA, Management and any officer and employee of the Group. It may invite any Director, Management, any officer or employee of the Group, the EA and IA to attend its meetings. It is also authorised to engage any firm of accountants, lawyers or other professionals as it sees fit to provide independent counsel and advice to assist in the review or investigation on such matters within its terms of reference as it deems appropriate, at the Company’s expense.\\nThe principal responsibility of the ARC is to assist the Board in maintaining a high standard of \\ncorporate governance, particularly by providing an independent review of the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s financial reporting process (including reviewing the accounting policies and practices of the Company and the Group on a consolidated basis) and key internal controls, including financial, operational, compliance, IT and risk management controls. Other duties within its written terms of reference include:\\n• to review significant financial reporting issues and judgements so as to ensure the integrity \\nof the Company’s and the Group’s financial statements, and of announcements on the Company’s and the Group’s financial performance and recommend changes, if any, to the Board;\\n• to review the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal \\ncontrols including financial, operational, compliance and IT controls and report to the Board;\\n• to assess the role and effectiveness of the IA function in the overall context of the Group’s \\nrisk management and internal control systems;\\n• to approve the appointment, termination, evaluation of performance and remuneration of \\nthe Head of IA within the Company’s human resource guidelines; Assurances from the KMP (Provision 9.2)In relation to Provision 9.2 of the 2018 Code and Rule 1207(10) of the Listing Manual, the ARC and the Board received: \\n(i) written assurance from the CEO, a KMP of the Company, and the Deputy CFO (in the absence \\nof the CFO), not being identified as the Company’s KMP, that the Group’s financial records have been properly maintained and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group’s operations and finances; and\\n(ii) written assurance from the Board Chairman and the CEO, both being identified as the \\nCompany’s KMP, that the Group’s system of internal controls and risk management systems in place are adequate and effective to address in all material respects the financial, operational, compliance and IT risks within the current scope of the Group’s business operations for FY 2022.\\nThe above written assurances provided by the KMP and/or the Deputy CFO are supported by written assurances provided by the Management of the Group’s listed subsidiaries/key business units. The Board in turn provided a negative assurance confirmation in respect of the unaudited financial statements for the first half year in accordance with the regulatory requirements.\\nThe ARC reviewed the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s key internal controls that address \\nthe Group’s financial, operational, compliance and IT controls, and risk management systems, with the assistance of the IA and EA and Management, who provide regular reports during the year to the ARC in addition to the briefings and updates provided at the ARC meetings. The management action plans are initiated to address the deficiencies identified by IA and EA, especially in the Group’s China operations.\\nBased on the work performed by IA and the risk committees during the financial year, as well \\nas observations shared by the EA, Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”) during the course of their audits of the Company and its significant subsidiaries, and the written assurance from the KMP, the Board, with the concurrence of the ARC, is of the opinion that the system of internal controls and risk management systems in place as at 31 December 2022 are adequate and effective to address in all material aspects the financial, operational, compliance and IT risks within the current scope of the Group’s business operations.\\nThe Board wishes to highlight that the majority of the Group’s businesses are located in China, \\nwhich is a challenging control environment to operate in.\\nThe Board noted that CYI, a subsidiary listed on the New York Stock Exchange, had in its FY \\n2021 annual report filing on Form 20F on 22 April 2022, disclosed that its Independent Public Accountants, EY, had concluded in their opinion, that CYI maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework).\\nAs of the date of this report, CYI is still in the process of evaluating its internal controls over \\nfinancial reporting. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) program will be subject to final review by the auditors, and is currently on-going. To date, CYI’s management has not received any report on material weaknesses from its auditors. The full results will not be known until the finalization of CYI’s FY 2022 annual report filing on Form 20F in April 2023.\\nAs part of internal audit program for FY 2022, audit findings identified control weaknesses at \\nsome of the Group’s subsidiaries. Management action plans based on IA’s recommendations were developed to address these weaknesses. EY, during the audit of the financial statements of the Group, had also identified certain deficiencies in internal controls, which had been reported to the ARC and are currently in the process of being rectified by Management. Management had assessed and determined that the deficiencies did not have significant financial impact on the financial statements of the Group for FY 2022.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

The following significant matters impacting the financial statements were discussed with Management and the EA:\\nSignificant Matters How did the ARC address these matters\\nImpairment of property, plant and equipmentManagement performed assessment of the recoverable amounts of property, plant and equipment with impairment indicators identified. The ARC had discussed with the Management and the EA and assessed the indicators of impairment and also reviewed the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and reasonableness of the key assumptions used in determining the recoverable amount of the property, plant and equipment.\\nCapitalisation \\nof development expenditureThe ARC reviewed the significant assumptions and estimates used by Management in the capitalisation of development expenditure.\\nThe ARC noted that about 63% of the intangible assets relates to development \\nexpenditure capitalised by CYI. From discussion with Management, the ARC noted that CYI obtained an understanding from its management on the recognition criteria and basis for capitalisation and performed an assessment of the appropriateness of development expenditure capitalised in accordance with CYI’s R&D capitalisation policy.\\nThe above significant matters were also areas of focus for EA who have included these as key audit \\nmatters in their audit report set out in this AR.\\nExternal Auditors (Provisions 10.1(d) and 10.1(e))\\nTaking cognizance that the EA should be free from any business or other relationships with the Group that could materially interfere with their ability to act with integrity and objectivity, the ARC undertook a review of the independence of EY and gave careful consideration to the Group’s relationships with them during 2022. In determining the independence of EY, the ARC reviewed the Group’s relationships with them and considered the nature and volume of the provision of the non-audit services in 2022 and the corresponding fees. The ARC is of the opinion that the nature and amount of such non-audit services and fees, which had not exceeded 50% of the aggregate audit fees paid/payable to EY in 2022, did not impair or threaten the audit independence. EY’s confirmation of their audit independence was further noted. Based on the review, the ARC is of the opinion that EY is, and is perceived to be, independent for the purpose of the Group’s statutory financial audit. The fees paid and/or payable by the Group to EY in respect of audit and non-audit services for FY 2022 are set out below:\\n$’000\\nAudit fees 1,183\\nNon-audit fees 20\\nIn reviewing the nomination of EY for re-appointment for the financial year ending 31 December 2023, the ARC had considered the adequacy of the resources, experience and competence of EY, and had taken into account the Audit Quality Indicators relating to the experience of the engagement partner and key team members’ experience in handling the audit of multi-listed entities under different jurisdictions. The size and complexity of the audit of the Group, the level of audit fee, and the number and experience of the supervisory and professional staff assigned were taken into account. The ARC had also considered the audit team’s ability to work in a co-operative manner with Management whilst maintaining integrity and objectivity and to deliver their services professionally and within agreed timelines.• to review annually the scope and results of the external audit and the independence and \\nobjectivity of the EA, and in this regard to also review the nature and extent of any non-audit services provided by the EA to the Group;\\n• to make recommendations to the Board on the nomination for the appointment, re-\\nappointment and/or removal of the EA, and to approve the remuneration and terms of engagement of the EA;\\n• to review interested person transactions (“ IPTs”) to ensure that they are entered on normal \\ncommercial terms and are not prejudicial to the interests of the Company or its minority shareholders;\\n• to oversee the establishment and operation of the whistle-blowing policy and arrangements \\nin place for raising, in confidence, concerns about possible improprieties on matters of financial reporting or any other matters in the Group;\\n• to provide oversight of the risk management framework for the purpose of guiding and \\nproviding direction to build up risk management capability within the Group; and\\n• to provide oversight on the Group’s compliance relating to sustainability governance \\nand reporting including reviewing the framework put in place by Management for the identification, assessment, management and monitoring of the material ESG factors, and setting of the targets and key performance indicators for the achievement of the Group’s sustainability strategy.\\nThe ARC held three meetings during the year and carried out its duties as set out within its terms of reference. For details of the activities performed by the ARC during the year, please refer to the ‘Directors’ Statement’ section on page 83 of this AR. The Company Secretaries maintain records of all ARC meetings including records of key deliberations and decisions taken. The ARC meets with the IA and EA, each separately without the presence of Management, at least once annually. \\nThe ARC members continually keep themselves abreast of changes to accounting standards and \\nissues which have a direct impact on financial statements.\\nFor the financial year under review, the ARC conducted a self-assessment of its own effectiveness \\nin the discharge of its roles and responsibilities, which was facilitated through the use of a self-assessment checklist (“ARC Self-Assessment Checklist”).\\nThe ARC Self-Assessment Checklist covered, inter alia, the responsibilities of the ARC under its \\nterms of reference, and considered the contribution of the ARC members to the ARC’s deliberation \\nand decision-making process.\\nBased on the self-assessment, the ARC believes that it has fulfilled its responsibilities and \\ndischarged its duties as set out in its terms of reference.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

IA’s coverage extends to the review and testing of controls in areas of key risks which include sales and channels operations, procurement, inventory management, information systems and compliance with company policies and procedures.\\nThe ARC approved the annual IA plan and received regular reports during 2022 on the progress \\nof the audit work under the IA plan. Copies of IA reports are extended to relevant members of Management. IA reports are also provided to the external auditors. Processes are in place such that recommendations raised in IA reports are followed up to ensure that they are dealt with within a reasonable time frame, taking into account the severity and nature of the control weaknesses identified. The ARC is apprised regularly on the implementation by Management of the recommendations of IA. \\nThe Company has a well-established IA function with formal procedures for the IA to report \\ntheir audit findings to the ARC and to Management. The IA members attend external training programmes to keep abreast of developments. As the Head of IA is a member of the Institute of Internal Auditors of Singapore and Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants, the team receives regular updates on the latest development of IA policies and practices, accounting pronouncements, risk-based audit information and other audit related knowledge from time to time. The ARC reviewed the effectiveness and adequacy of the IA function including its resources through a review of the IA activities on a regular basis as well as its annual assessment of the IA function. The assessment was facilitated through the use of an evaluation framework modeled on the framework recommended in the Guidebook for Audit Committees in Singapore. The evaluation framework covers IA organisation, resources and continuing training, audit plans, work scope, quality of reports and recommendations, IA Charter and IA internal control assessment. Based on the assessment conducted for 2022, the ARC is satisfied with the quality and effectiveness of the IA function and that the IA function has adequate resources and appropriate independent standing within the Group to perform its functions properly, and the ARC has continually emphasized the importance of ensuring that the IA function is adequately staffed, especially to handle the review and testing of controls in key risk areas in the Group’s operations in China. CYI has its own IA team and the other two China operations of the Group are not material.\\nSHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND ENGAGEMENT\\nPRINCIPLE 11: SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND CONDUCT OF GENERAL MEETINGSBeing committed to good corporate practices, the Company treats all shareholders fairly and equitably. To facilitate the exercise of shareholders’ rights, the Company ensures that all material information relating to the Group and its financial performance is disclosed in an accurate and timely manner via SGXNet.\\nGeneral Meetings (Provisions 11.1, 11.2, 11.3)\\nShareholders are informed of general meetings through notices sent to them. All shareholders are entitled to attend and vote at general meetings in person or by proxy or in the case of a corporate shareholder, through its appointed representative.

The stakeholders have been identified as those who are impacted by the Group’s business and operations and those who similarly impact the Group’s business and operations. The six key stakeholder groups identified are customers, employees, government agencies, local communities, shareholders and suppliers.\\nThe Company acknowledges that success and long-term value across its operations would not be \\npossible without the Management’s dedication and careful attention towards managing supplier, customer, government agency and community relationships. This has only strengthened with a combined knowledge across various industries, which has allowed the Group’s businesses to both gain vital knowledge and adopt tested, effective policies and measures to evolve supplier collaboration, improve products’ standards and enhance customer service. To achieve such standards, the Group’s Management adopt industry-specific practices to create supportive environments and set codes of ethical business conduct that allow employees to thrive and in turn, help cultivate long-term working relationships with all stakeholders that support our business activities.In support of greater transparency and to allow for a more efficient voting system, the Company had been conducting electronic poll voting since its 2014 AGM up to the 2019 AGM.

Our \\nresponsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (“ACRA Code”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\\nKey Audit MattersKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance \\nin our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\\nWe have fulfilled our responsibilities described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the \\nFinancial Statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters.

We also tested the controls over the authorisation, approval and recording of expenses and controls over monitoring of the status of the ongoing Development Projects. We evaluated management’s judgement relating to the determination of the research and development phases and the determination of which development expenditure can be capitalised by conducting inquiries of the engineers in the Research and Development (“R&D”) department to understand the progress of the Development Projects. We checked, on a sampling basis, the status of the projects and the cost capitalised by agreeing these amounts to supporting documents and the Company’s capitalisation criteria. We also evaluated management’s assessment that the Development Projects continued to be in progress by inspecting the testers’ feedback and responses from the R&D department on a sample basis.\\nWe also assessed the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures concerning this in Note 39 Significant \\naccounting judgements and estimates and Note 4 Intangible assets to the financial statements.\\nOther InformationManagement is responsible for other information. The other information comprises the information \\nincluded in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.\\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not \\nexpress any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other \\ninformation and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\\nResponsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial StatementsManagement is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair \\nview in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I), and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.\\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability \\nto continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\\nThe directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.INDEPENDENT \\nAUDITOR’S REPORT \\nFor the financial year ended 31 December 2022\\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF HONG LEONG ASIA LTD.\\nKey Audit Matters (cont’d)\\nImpairment of property, plant and equipmentAs at 31 December 2022, the carrying amount of the Group’s property, plant and equipment is \\n$887.9 million. \\nManagement has identified impairment indicators in the property, plant and equipment of certain \\nsubsidiaries within the Building Materials segment with carrying amount of $53.7 million due to operating losses. Accordingly, management has estimated the recoverable amounts of these assets based on value-in-use calculations. No impairment loss was recorded as a result of the assessment. Given the magnitude of the amount and the significant management judgements involved in the impairment assessment, we have identified this as a key audit matter.\\nWe carried out procedures to understand management’s process for identifying impairment \\ntriggers, and considered management’s impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment. For those assets with impairment indicators, our audit procedures included, amongst others, assessing the reasonableness of the recoverable amount determined by management and the valuation method used. \\nThe recoverable amounts of the property, plant and equipment with impairment indicators were \\ndetermined by management using value-in-use calculations. We evaluated the reasonableness of the key assumptions used in the underlying cash flow forecasts as approved by the Board of directors, which include the discount rate, budgeted revenue and expected margins by comparing against historical performance and macroeconomic information. This included an evaluation of how management had considered the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic in their assessment of the key assumptions and inputs used in the forecasts. We also involved our internal valuation specialists to assist us in reviewing the reasonableness of the discount rates used. \\nWe further assessed the adequacy of the disclosures on the key assumptions and their sensitivity \\nanalysis in Note 39 Significant accounting judgements and estimates and Note 5 Impairment assessment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment to the financial statements.\\nCapitalisation of development expenditureAs at 31 December 2022, the carrying amount of the Group’s intangible assets amounted to \\n$323.5 million, of which $202.7 million pertained to development expenditure that was capitalised by the diesel engines segment. Prior to the financial year ended 31 December 2020, the Group had commenced the process to research and develop new engine models to comply with the new engine emission standards as promulgated by the People’s Republic of China (the “Development Projects”). The efforts to develop such new engines continued during the financial year ended 31 December 2022.  The Group has determined that the Development Projects met the capitalisation criteria and has capitalised $202.7 million of development expenditure. This includes $37.0 million capitalised during the year. There was significant management judgement involved in determining what constitutes development activities, when a project moves from the research phase into the development phase and what expenses qualify for capitalisation.INDEPENDENT \\nAUDITOR’S REPORT \\nFor the financial year ended 31 December 2022\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain \\nprofessional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether \\ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and \\nobtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. \\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit \\nprocedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.\\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of \\naccounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of \\naccounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including \\nthe disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\\n• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the \\nentities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\\nWe communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and \\ntiming of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\\nWe also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \\nrequirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.INDEPENDENT \\nAUDITOR’S REPORT \\nFor the financial year ended 31 December 2022\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)\\n2.4 Basis of consolidation and business combinations (cont’d)\\n(a) Basis of consolidation (cont’d)\\nA change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted \\nfor as an equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:\\n– Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at \\ntheir carrying amounts at the date when control is lost;\\n– Derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest;\\n– Derecognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity;\\n– Recognises the fair value of the consideration received;\\n– Recognises the fair value of any investment retained;\\n– Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss;\\n– Re-classifies the Group’s share of components previously recognised in other \\ncomprehensive income to profit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate.\\n(b) Business combinations\\nBusiness combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. \\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognised as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received.\\nWhen the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities \\nassumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contract by the acquiree.\\nAny contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair \\nvalue at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, will be recognised in accordance with SFRS(I) 9 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.\\nIn business combinations achieved in stages, previously held equity interests in the \\nacquiree are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date and any corresponding gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.\\nThe Group elects for each individual business combination, whether non-controlling \\ninterest in the acquiree (if any), that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of net assets in the event of liquidation, is recognised on the acquisition date at fair value, or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Other components of non-controlling interests are measured at their acquisition date fair value, unless another measurement basis is required by another SFRS(I).2.

The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prepared for the same reporting date as the Company.\\xa0Consistent accounting policies are applied to like transactions and events in similar circumstances. \\nAll intra-group balances, income and expenses and unrealised gains and losses resulting \\nfrom intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full. \\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the \\nGroup obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. \\nLosses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interest even if that \\nresults in a deficit balance.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)\\n2.8 Associates and joint ventures\\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has the power to participate in the financial \\nand operating policy decisions of the investee but does not have control or joint control of those policies.\\nThe Group accounts for its investments in associates and joint ventures using the equity \\nmethod from the date on which it becomes an associate or joint venture.\\nOn acquisition of the investment, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s \\nshare of the net fair value of the investee’s identifiable assets and liabilities represents goodwill and is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the investee’s identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment is included as income in the determination of the entity’s share of the associate or joint venture’s profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.\\nUnder the equity method, the investment in associates or joint ventures are carried in the \\nbalance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associates or joint ventures. The profit or loss reflects the share of results of the operations of the associates or joint ventures. Distributions received from joint ventures or associates reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Where there has been a change recognised in other comprehensive income by the associates or joint venture, the Group recognises its share of such changes in other comprehensive income. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and associate or joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associates or joint ventures.\\nWhen the Group’s share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest \\nin the associate or joint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.\\nAfter application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to \\nrecognise an additional impairment loss on the Group’s investment in associate or joint ventures. The Group determines at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate or joint venture is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate or joint venture and its carrying value and recognises the amount in profit or loss. \\nThe financial statements of the associates and joint ventures are prepared as the same \\nreporting date as the Company. Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.\\nUpon loss of significant influence or joint control over the associate or joint venture, the \\nGroup measures the retained interest at fair value. Any difference between the fair value of the aggregate of the retained interest and proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the investment at the date the equity method was discontinued is recognised in profit or loss.\\nIf the Group’s ownership interest in an associate or a joint venture is reduced, but the Group \\ncontinues to apply the equity method, the Group reclassifies to profit or loss the proportion of the gain or loss that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that reduction in ownership interest if that gain or loss would be required to be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities.2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)\\n2.4 Basis of consolidation and business combinations (cont’d)\\n(b) Business combinations (cont’d)\\nAny excess of the sum of the fair value of the consideration transferred in the business \\ncombination, the amount of non-controlling interest in the acquiree (if any), and the fair value of the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), over the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The accounting policy for goodwill is set out in Note 2.13(a). In instances where the latter amount exceeds the former, the excess is recognised as gain on bargain purchase in profit or loss on the acquisition date.\\n2.5 Transactions with non-controlling interests\\nNon-controlling interest represents the equity in subsidiaries not attributable, directly or indirectly, to owners of the Company.\\nChanges in the Company’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss \\nof control are accounted for as equity transactions. In such circumstances, the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company.\\n2.6 Subsidiaries\\nA subsidiary is an investee that is controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\\nIn the Company’s balance sheet, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less \\nimpairment losses.\\n2.7\\n Joint arrangements\\nA joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties have joint \\ncontrol. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\\nA joint arrangement is classified either as joint operation or joint venture, based on the rights \\nand obligations of the parties to the arrangement.\\nTo the extent the joint arrangement provides the Group with rights to the assets and \\nobligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement, the arrangement is a joint operation. To the extent the joint arrangement provides the Group with rights to the net assets of the arrangement, the arrangement is a joint venture.\\n Joint ventures\\nThe Group recognises its interest in a joint venture as an investment and accounts for the investment using the equity method. The accounting policy for investment in joint venture is set out in Note 2.8.\\nThe Group has not entered into any joint operation arrangement.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)\\n2.10 Property, plant and equipment \\nAll items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent to \\nrecognition, property, plant and equipment other than freehold land are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\\nThe cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment and \\nborrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying property, plant and equipment. The accounting policy for borrowing costs is set out in Note 2.24. The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an asset if, and only if, it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\\nWhen significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced in \\nintervals, the Group depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives.\\xa0Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.\\xa0All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.\\nFreehold land has an unlimited useful life and therefore is not depreciated. Depreciation is \\ncomputed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\\nBuildings and leasehold land  :  Over the period of the lease ranging from 1\\xa0to \\na maximum of 50 years\\nLeasehold improvements  : 1\\xa0to 50 years\\nPlant and machinery  : 3 to 30 years\\nOffice furniture, fittings and equipment  : 3 to 20 years\\nMotor and transport vehicles  : 3 to 15 years\\nConstruction-in-progress is not depreciated as it is not yet available for use. \\nThe carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when \\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. \\nThe residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each financial year-\\nend, and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. \\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future \\neconomic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset is included in profit or loss in the year the asset is derecognised.2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)\\n2.9 Foreign currency \\nThe financial statements are presented in Singapore Dollars, which is also the Company’s functional currency.\\xa0Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.\\n(a) Transactions and balances\\nTransactions in foreign currencies are measured in the respective functional currencies \\nof the Company and its subsidiaries and are recorded on initial recognition in the functional currencies at exchange rates approximating those ruling at the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured. \\nExchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating \\nmonetary items at the end of the reporting period are recognised in profit or loss.\\n(b) Consolidated financial statements\\nFor consolidation purpose, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are \\ntranslated into SGD at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period and their profit or loss are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on the translation are recognised in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of other comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in profit or loss. \\nIn the case of a partial disposal without loss of control of a subsidiary that includes a \\nforeign operation, the proportionate share of the cumulative amount of the exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling interest and are not recognised in profit or loss. For partial disposals of associates or jointly-controlled entities that are foreign operations, the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to profit or loss. \\nExchange differences arising on monetary items that form part of the Group’s net \\ninvestment in foreign operations are recognised initially in other comprehensive income and accumulated under foreign currency translation reserve in equity. The foreign currency translation reserve is reclassified from equity to profit or loss of the Group on disposal of the foreign operation.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial acquisition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in profit or loss in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.\\nThe useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised over the estimated useful lives \\nand assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.\\xa0The amortisation period and the amortisation method are reviewed at least at each financial year-end.\\xa0Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.\\xa0\\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives or not yet available for use are tested for \\nimpairment annually, or more frequently if the events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. Such intangible assets are not amortised. The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the useful life assessment continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.\\nGains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the \\ndifference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)\\n2.11 Investment property\\nInvestment property is property owned by the Group that is held to earn rentals, rather than for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, or in the ordinary course of business. \\nInvestment property is initially measured at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property is carried at cost less accumulated \\ndepreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated using straight-line method to allocate the depreciable amounts over the estimated useful lives of 30 years. The residual values, useful lives and depreciation method of investment properties are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each balance sheet date.\\nInvestment property is de-recognised when either they have been disposed of or when the \\ninvestment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. Any gain or loss on the retirement or disposal of an investment property is recognised in profit or loss in the year of retirement or disposal.\\n2.12 Government grants\\nGovernment grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions will be complied with. Where the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is recognised as deferred capital grant on the balance sheet and is amortised to income statement over the expected useful life of the relevant asset by equal annual instalments. Where the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income on a systematic basis over the periods in which the entity recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.\\n2.13 Intangible assets\\n(a) Goodwill\\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured \\nat cost less any accumulated impairment losses.\\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination \\nis, from the acquisition date, allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.\\nThe cash-generating units to which goodwill have been allocated is tested for \\nimpairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the cash-generating unit may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods.\\nWhere goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within \\nthat cash-generating unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.\\xa0Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative fair values of the operations disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.\\nTrade receivables are measured at the amount of consideration to which the Group \\nexpects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third party, if the trade receivables do not contain a significant financing component at initial recognition. \\nSubsequent measurementInvestments in debt instrumentsSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s business model \\nfor managing the asset and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset. The three measurement categories for classification of debt instruments are:\\n(i) Amortised cost\\nFinancial assets that are held for the collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less impairment.\\xa0Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the assets are derecognised or impaired, and through the amortisation process.\\n(ii) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)\\nFinancial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Financial assets measured at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair value. Any gains or losses from changes in fair value of the financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses, foreign exchange gains and losses and interest calculated using the effective interest method are recognised in profit or loss.\\xa0The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment when the financial asset is derecognised.\\n(iii) Fair value through profit or loss\\nAssets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\\xa0A gain or loss on a debt instrument that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it arises.2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)\\n2.13 Intangible assets (cont’d)\\n(b) Other intangible assets (cont’d)\\n(i) Trademarks\\nTrademarks acquired are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Trademark with finite useful lives are amortised over the estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that trademark may be impaired. The amortisation expense and impairment loss are recognised in profit or loss in the expenses category consistent with the function of the trademarks.\\nTrademarks with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, or \\nmore frequently if the events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. \\n(ii) Research and development costs\\nResearch costs are expensed as incurred. Deferred development costs arising from development expenditures on an individual project are recognised as an intangible asset when the Group can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale, its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset, how the asset will generate future economic benefits, the availability of resources to complete and the ability to measure reliably the expenditures during the development. \\nFollowing initial recognition of the deferred development costs as an intangible \\nasset, it is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation of the intangible asset begins when development is complete and the asset is available for use. Deferred development costs is amortised over the estimated useful lives of the period of expected pattern of future economic benefits embodied in the development. The amortisation expense is recognised in profit or loss. During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually. \\n(iii) Technology know-how\\nTechnology know-how is amortised on a straight-line basis over its finite useful life of 8 years.\\n(iv) Club membership\\nClub membership was acquired separately and is amortised on a straight-line basis over its finite useful life of 10 years.\\n(v) Computer softwares\\nComputer softwares have a finite useful life and are amortised over the period of estimated useful life of 5 years on a straight-line basis.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)\\n2.18 Impairment of financial assets  (cont’d)\\nThe Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are more than \\n360 days from the invoice date. However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.\\n2.19 Impairment of non-financial assets\\nThe Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.\\xa0If any indication exists, or when an annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. \\nAn asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value \\nless costs of disposal and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or group of assets.\\xa0Where the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.\\xa0\\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by \\nthe asset are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.\\xa0In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account, if available.\\xa0If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.\\xa0These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. \\nThe Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations \\nwhich are prepared separately for each of the Group’s cash-generating units to which the individual assets are allocated.\\xa0These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.\\nImpairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in profit or loss.A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in \\nthe estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.\\xa0If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.\\xa0That increase cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised previously.\\xa0Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss.2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)\\n2.17 Development properties\\nDevelopment properties are properties acquired or being constructed for sale in the ordinary course of business, rather than to be held for the Group’s own use, rental or capital appreciation.\\nDevelopment properties are held as inventories and are measured at the lower of cost and \\nnet realisable value.\\nNon-refundable commissions paid to sales or marketing agents on the sale of real estate \\nunits are expensed when incurred. Costs to complete development include cost of land and other direct and related development expenditure, including borrowing costs incurred in developing the properties. \\nNet realisable value of development properties is the estimated selling price in the ordinary \\ncourse of business, based on market prices at the reporting date and discounted for the time value of money if material, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\\nThe costs of development properties recognised in profit or loss on disposal are determined \\nwith reference to the specific costs incurred on the property sold and an allocation of any non-specific costs based on the relative size of the property sold.\\n2.18 Impairment of financial assets\\nThe Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss and financial guarantee contracts. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.\\nECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a \\nsignificant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognised for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).\\nFor trade receivables and capitalised contract costs, the Group applies a simplified approach \\nin calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.\\nFor bill receivables at fair value through OCI, the Group assesses the credit risk of the financial \\ninstitution, which issue the bills, at every reporting date. The Group evaluates whether the bills are considered to have low credit risk using all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

The amount of revenue recognised is the amount allocated to the satisfied performance obligation.\\n(a) Sale of engines\\nRevenue from sale of engines is recognised when the engines are delivered to the \\ncustomer and all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.\\nThe Group considers whether there are other promises in the contract that are \\nseparate performance obligations to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be allocated (e.g. warranties). 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)\\n2.20 Employee benefits\\n(a) Defined contribution plans\\nThe Group participates in the national pension schemes as defined by the laws of the \\ncountries in which it has operations.\\xa0The Singapore and Malaysia companies in the Group make contributions to the Central Provident Fund scheme in Singapore and the Employee Provident Fund in Malaysia respectively, a defined contribution pension scheme.\\xa0The companies in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) participate in and make contributions to the national pension schemes at a fixed proportion of the basic salary of the employee.\\xa0Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the period in which the related service is performed. \\n(b) Short-term benefits\\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and \\nare expensed as the related service is provided.\\nA provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present \\nlegal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. Employment benefits are classified as short term or non-current based on expected timing of settlement.\\n(c) Share-based payments\\nThe share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Group \\ncompanies.\\xa0The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.\\xa0The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.\\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options \\nthat are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates in employee expense with a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.\\n2.21 Provisions\\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.\\nProvisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the \\ncurrent best estimate. If it is no longer probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.\\xa0When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

Sale of cement and related products are generally on 30 to 90 days terms.\\nThe Group considers whether there are other promises in the contract that are \\nseparate performance obligations to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be allocated. In determining the transaction price for the sale of cement and related products, the Group considers the effects of variable consideration.\\n– Variable consideration\\nIf the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, the Group estimates the amount of consideration to which they will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Some contracts for the sale of cement and related products provide customers with prompt payment rebates and volume rebates. The prompt payment rebates and volume rebates give rise to variable consideration.\\n– Early payment rebates\\nThe Group provides prompt payment rebates to customers who settle the payments within certain period of time specified in the contract.\\n– Volume rebates\\nThe Group provides retrospective volume rebates to certain customers once the quantity of products purchased during the period exceeds a threshold specified in the contract.\\n(c) Sale of rigid packaging products \\nRevenue from sale of rigid packaging products is recognised at the point in time when \\ncontrol of the goods is transferred to the customer.\\n(d) Rendering of services\\nRevenue from rendering services relates to project management contracts, and hotel \\nroom and restaurant operations. Revenue is recognised over the period in which the services are rendered, by reference to completion of the specific transaction assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total services to be performed.\\n(e) Development properties for sale\\nRevenue is recognised when control over property has been transferred to the customer, \\neither over time or at a point in time, depending on the contractual terms and practices in the legal jurisdiction.2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)\\n2.22 Revenue from contracts with customers (cont’d)\\n(a) Sale of engines (cont’d)\\n– Service-type warranty\\nThe Group provides certain warranties for both repairs and maintenance service as part of the sales of engines. For general repairs, such warranties will be assurance-type warranties which will continue to be accounted for under SFRS(I) 1-37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. Warranty for maintenance service is a distinct service to the customer in addition to the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon specifications. Under SFRS(I) 15, the Group accounts for service-type warranty as a separate performance obligation to which the Group allocates a portion of the transaction price. The portion of the consideration allocated to the service-type warranty is initially recorded as a contract liability and recognised as revenue upon the service rendered.\\n– Variable consideration\\nThe Group enters into contractual arrangements to provide certain customers with sales rebates when the quantity of products purchased during the period exceeds a threshold specified in the contract. To estimate the variable consideration for the expected future rebates, the Group applies the most likely amount method for each individual contract. The Group then applies the requirements on constraining estimates of variable consideration and recognises a liability in “Trade and other payables” for the expected future rebates to be utilised by the customers. Based on contractual arrangements with the customers, the rebates are netted against “Trade receivables”, and only amounts in excess of “Trade receivables” continue to be recognised as refund liabilities in “Trade and other payables”.\\nThe Group does not extend its sales returns policy to all customers.  However, \\nthe Group allows for certain returns, only on a case-by-case basis. The Group estimates the provision for such returns based on the historical return rates and accounts for it as a reduction in revenue and forms part of refund liability that is recognised in “Trade and other payables”.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)\\n2.23 Leases\\nThe Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, \\nif the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. \\n(a) As lessee\\nThe Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, \\nexcept for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. \\nRight-of-use assetsThe Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., \\nthe date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:\\nLeasehold land and land use rights   1 to 78 years \\nBuilding and office space   1 to 6 years \\nMotor and transport vehicles   12 years \\nOffice furniture, fittings and equipment   3 to 5 years \\nIf ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.\\nThe right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to accounting policies in \\nNote 2.19. \\nLease liabilitiesAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities \\nmeasured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)\\n2.22 Revenue from contracts with customers (cont’d)\\n(f) Rental income\\nRental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis \\nover the lease terms and is included in revenue in the statement of profit or loss due to its operating nature.\\n(g) Dividend income\\nDividend income is recognised when the Group’s right to receive payment is established.\\n(h) Interest incomeInterest income is recognised using the effective interest method.\\nContract balancesCapitalised contract costs The capitalised contract costs are costs which have been capitalised and are directly related \\nto a contract, for which resources were used in satisfying the contract and are expected to be recovered.\\nCapitalised contract costs are subsequently recognised in profit or loss as the Group \\nrecognises the related revenue. An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the capitalised contract costs exceeds the remaining amount of consideration that the Group expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services to which the contract costs relates less the costs that relate directly to providing the goods and that have not been recognised as expenses.  \\nTrade receivablesA receivable represents the Group’s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional. \\nRefer to Note 2.14 for details.\\nContract liabilitiesA contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which \\nthe Group has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Group transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group performs under the contract.\\nRight of return assetsA right-of-return asset is recognised for the right to recover the goods expected to be returned \\nby customers. The asset is measured at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods and any potential decreases in value. The Group updates the measurement of the asset for any revisions to the expected level of returns and any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)\\n2.25 Taxes (cont’d)\\n(a) Current income tax (cont’d)\\nCurrent income taxes are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that the \\ntax relates to items recognised outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.\\n(b) Deferred tax\\nDeferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the \\nend of the reporting period between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.\\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences, except:\\n– Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or \\nof an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, \\nat the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and\\n– In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in \\nsubsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. \\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except: \\n– Where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference \\narises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and \\n– In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in \\nsubsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. \\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)\\n2.23 Leases (cont’d)\\n(a) As lessee (cont’d)\\nLease liabilities (cont’d)In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental \\nborrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.\\nShort-term leases and leases of low-value assetsThe Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases \\nof machinery and equipment (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\n(b) As lessor\\nLeases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards \\nincidental to ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in other income in the income statement. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as income in the period in which they are earned.\\n2.24 Borrowing costs\\nBorrowing costs are capitalised as part of the cost of a qualifying asset if they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of that asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale are in progress and the expenditures and borrowing costs are incurred.\\xa0Borrowing costs are capitalised until the assets are substantially completed for their intended use or sale.\\xa0All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur.\\xa0Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.\\n2.25 Taxes\\n(a) Current income tax\\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured \\nat the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.\\xa0The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)\\n2.27 Non-current assets held for sale and distribution to owners (cont’d)\\nProperty, plant and equipment once classified as held for sale are not depreciated.\\n2.28 Contingencies\\nA contingent liability is:\\n(a) a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed \\nonly by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not \\nwholly within the control of the Group; or\\n(b) a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:\\n(i) It is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will \\nbe required to settle the obligation; or \\n(ii) The amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.\\nA contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.\\nContingent liabilities and assets are not recognised on the balance sheet of the Group, except \\nfor contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination that are present obligations and which the fair values can be reliably determined.\\n2.29 Earnings per share\\nThe Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares.\\xa0 Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise share options granted to employees.\\n2.30 Segment reporting\\nFor management purposes, the Group is organised into operating segments based on their products and services which are independently managed by the respective segment managers responsible for the performance of the respective segments under their charge. The segment managers report directly to the management of the Company who regularly review the segment results in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess the segment performance.\\xa0Additional disclosures on each of these segments are shown in Note\\xa038, including the factors used to identify the reportable segments and the measurement basis of segment information.2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)\\n2.25 Taxes (cont’d)\\n(b) Deferred tax (cont’d)\\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to \\napply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of each reporting period. \\nDeferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside \\nprofit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and deferred tax arising from a business combination is adjusted against goodwill on acquisition. \\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right \\nexists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.\\nTax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria \\nfor separate recognition at that date, are recognised subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances change. The adjustment is either treated as a reduction to goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the measurement period or recognised in profit or loss.\\n(c) Sales tax\\nRevenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except: \\n– Where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable \\nfrom the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of \\nthe cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and\\n– Receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of sales tax included.\\nThe net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.\\n2.26 Cash and cash equivalents\\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand, demand deposits, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\\xa0These also include bank overdrafts that form an integral part of the Group’s cash management.\\n2.27 Non-current assets held for sale and distribution to owners\\nNon-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale and distribution to owners are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\\xa0Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for distribution to owners if the Group is committed to distribute the asset or disposal group to the owners. A component of the Group is classified as a ‘discontinued operation’ when the criteria to be classified as held for distribution to owners have been met or it has been disposed of and such a component represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND \\nEQUIPMENT \\nDiesel engines segment\\nTechnology know-howThe Group has an intangible asset representing technology development costs relating to the \\nproduction of 4Y20 engines. In 2018, the development of the engine platform was completed and the related technology development costs were recognised as technology know-how. As at 31 December 2022, the carrying amount was $1,136,000 (2021: $1,440,000) (net of accumulated impairment losses, accumulated amortisation and exchange difference).\\nIn late 2018, the Group had commenced the production of 4Y20 engines. Management believed \\nthat there was no indicator for further impairment in 2021 and 2022. Also, having considered that there was no significant change to the market and economic environment that will have a favorable effect to the recoverable amount of the intangible asset, management had concluded that no reversal of impairment was necessary in 2021 and 2022. \\nIn addition, the development of certain engine platform relating to National VI engines was \\ncompleted in 2022 and the related development expenditure amounted to $23,360,000 (2021: $87,959,000) (net of exchange difference) was transferred from development expenditure to \\ntechnology know-how. 4. INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONT’D)\\nDevelopment expenditure\\nDevelopment expenditure relates to costs incurred for the following:\\n– design, construction and testing of new diesel engines and new energy products\\n– exploration and evaluation expenditure of quarries, quarry use right\\n– cost saving on granites extraction projects to secure supply\\n– removal of waste to enable access to the mineral ore\\nThe development expenditure has remaining amortisation period of 1 to 3 years (2021: 1 to 3 \\nyears).\\xa0\\xa0Development expenditure for the design, construction and testing of new diesel engines and new energy products amounting to $202,742,000 (2021: $210,438,000) is not amortised as the development has not been completed and is not available for use.\\nTechnology know-howTechnology know-how relates to an intellectual property right of a technology for building of \\nnew heavy duty diesel engines and certain engine platform relating to National VI engines, and \\nhas remaining amortisation period of 7 years (2021: 8 years). \\nTrademarksTrademarks belonging to the Group’s diesel engines segment and lifestyle appliances unit \\nare estimated to have an indefinite useful life because management believes that there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the trademarks are expected to generate net cash inflows for the Group.  \\nAmortisation expenseThe amortisation of club membership are included in the “General and administrative expenses” \\nline items in the income statement. The amortisation of technology know-how, computer software and other intangible assets is included mainly in the “Cost of sales” and “General and administrative expenses” line items in the income statement.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND \\nEQUIPMENT (CONT’D)\\nDiesel engines segment (cont’d)\\nTrademarkIn 2019, the Group entered into a trademark licence agreement under which the Group was granted \\nan exclusive and perpetual use of the trademarks listed in the trademark license agreement for a one-time usage fee of $32,791,000 (net of exchange difference). As at 31\\xa0December 2022, the carrying amount was $32,723,000 (2021: $36,017,000) (net of exchange difference).\\nManagement has assessed the right to use of the trademark licence according to the clauses, \\nterms and conditions in the agreement and is of the view that the Group has the right to use the trademark licence for unlimited period.  \\nAnnually, the Group performs an impairment test on the trademark, which has been identified \\nas a separate CGU for impairment testing purposes. No impairment was identified in 2021 and 2022.\\nThe recoverable amount of the unit was determined based on a value in use calculation using \\ncash flow projections from financial budgets approved by the management covering a 10-year period.\\nThe assumptions used in the assessment for the trademark in 2022 were:\\n– Profit from operation was based on management’s estimate with reference to historical \\nperformance and future business outlook.\\n– Discount rate of 14.3% (2021: 12.5%), which reflects management’s estimate of the risks \\nspecific to the CGU, was estimated based on weighted average cost of capital.\\n– Growth rate was based on management’s estimate with reference to general available \\nindication of long-term average growth rate of the PRC. The long-term rate used to \\nextrapolate the budget was 5.0% (2021: 5.0%).\\nA decrease in demand can lead to a decline in profit from operation. If the demand decreases by 26.7% (2021: 15.2%) from management’s estimate, it would result in impairment of the trademark. If the pre-tax discount rate increases to 18.0% (2021: 14.0%), it would result in impairment of the trademark. \\nWith regard to the assessment of value in use, management believes that no reasonably possible \\nchange in any of the above key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to materially fall below the carrying value.\\nProperty, plant and equipmentSeparately, the Group recognised an impairment loss of $3,524,000 (2021: $1,507,000) in the \\nincome statement under the line item “Cost of sales” in respect of specific plant and equipment which were no longer in use.5.  IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND \\nEQUIPMENT (CONT’D)\\nDiesel engines segment (cont’d)\\nDevelopment expenditureAs at 31 December 2022, the Group has capitalised technology development costs of $202,742,000 \\n(2021: $210,438,000) (net of exchange difference) mainly for new engines that comply with National VI and Tier 4 emission standards. \\nAnnually, the Group performs an impairment test on the development expenditure that are not \\navailable for use. No impairment was identified in 2021 and 2022.\\nThe recoverable amount was determined based on its value in use using the discounted cash \\nflow approach. Cash flows were projected based on historical growth, past experience and management’s best estimation of future business outlook. \\nThe 2022 cash flow forecast with 7 years’ projection period (2021: 8 years’ projection period) \\nwas based on the updated financial budgets approved by the senior management with no terminal value. \\nThe assumptions used in the assessment for the development expenditure in 2022 were:\\n– Profit from operation was based on management’s estimate with reference to historical \\nrevenue generated, growth rate and estimation of future business outlook. The revenue \\ngrowth rate was estimated at a range of 15% to 20% year-on-year from 2023 to 2027 in view of the implementation of new emission standards, and  an accelerated growth for new energy products due to the government’s emphasis on new energy. Thereafter, management assumed no revenue growth from 2028 to 2029 (2021: The revenue growth rate was estimated at around 12.0% year-on-year from 2022 to 2025, and expected to decrease to 5.0% in 2026. Management assumed no revenue growth from 2027 to 2029).\\n– Discount rate of 14.3% (2021: 12.5%), which reflects management’s estimate of the risks \\nspecific to the cash-generating unit (“CGU”), was estimated based on weighted average cost of capital.\\nA decrease in demand can lead to a decline in profit from operation. If the demand decreases by 4.9% (2021: 13.9%) from management’s estimate, it would result in impairment of the development expenditure. If the pre-tax discount rate increases to 19.2% (2021: 15.7%), it would result in impairment of the development expenditure. \\nWith regard to the assessment of value in use, management believes that no reasonably possible \\nchange in any of the above key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to materially fall below the carrying value.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE (CONT’D)\\nRelationship between tax expense and accounting profit (cont’d)\\nCertain subsidiaries of the Group in the PRC have been granted a concessionary tax rate \\nunder the Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”) Law of the PRC. Income from these entities is subject to tax at the concessionary rate of 15% instead of the national standard income tax rate of 25% (2021: 25%). This concession is available subject to certain conditions including these entities remain engaged in advanced and new technology.\\nThe CIT law also provides for a tax of 10% to be withheld from dividends paid to foreign \\ninvestors of the PRC enterprises. This withholding tax provision does not apply to dividends paid out of profits earned prior to 1 January 2008. Beginning on 1 January 2008, a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends paid to the Group, as a non-resident enterprise, unless an applicable tax treaty provides for a lower tax rate and the Group will recognise a provision for withholding tax payable for profits accumulated after 31\\xa0December 2007 for the earnings that the Group does not plan to indefinitely reinvest in the PRC enterprises.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES\\nRisk management is integral to the whole business of the Group and the Company.\\xa0 The management continually monitors the Group’s and the Company’s risk management process to ensure that an appropriate balance between risk and control is achieved. The Group’s and the Company’s policies and financial authority limits are documented and reviewed periodically.\\xa0The financial authority limits seek to limit and mitigate operational risk by setting threshold of approvals required for the entry into contractual obligations and investments.\\n(a)\\n Credit risk\\nCredit risk is the risk of loss that may arise on outstanding financial instruments should \\na counterparty default on its obligations.\\xa0The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to credit risk arises primarily from trade and other receivables. For other financial assets, the Group and the Company minimise credit risk by dealing exclusively with high credit rating counterparties.\\nManagement has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on \\nan ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are performed for all customers requiring credit over a certain amount. The Group and the Company require collateral in respect of financial assets in certain circumstances.\\nThe Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether \\nthere has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period.\\nThe Group has determined the default event on a financial asset to be when the customer \\nis unlikely to pay its contractual obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is held).  \\nThe Group considers “low risk” to be an investment grade credit rating with at least one major rating agency for those investments with credit rating. To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the asset as at reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. The Group considers available reasonable and supportive forward-looking information which includes the following indicators:\\n– Internal credit rating;\\n– External credit rating;\\n– Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic \\nconditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the debtor’s ability to meet its obligation;\\n– Actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the debtor;\\n– Significant increases in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same debtor;\\n– Significant changes in the value of the collateral supporting the obligation or in the \\nquality of third-party guarantees or credit enhancements; and\\n– Significant changes in the expected performance and behaviour of the debtor, \\nincluding changes in the payment status of debtors in the group and changes in the operating results of the debtor.34.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONT’D)\\n(b) Interest rate risk\\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group’s and the \\nCompany’s financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from their loans and borrowings and short-term deposits. \\nThe Group’s and the Company’s policy is to maintain an efficient and optimal interest cost \\nstructure using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts. The Group’s and the Company’s debt obligations are mainly denominated in Singapore Dollar, United States Dollar, Chinese Renminbi and Ringgit Malaysia, and at fixed and floating rates of interest. For variable rate financial instruments, a change of 100\\xa0bp in interest rate at the reporting date would increase/(decrease) profit before income tax by the amounts shown below.\\nProfit before income \\ntax\\n100 bp 100 bp\\nIncrease Decrease\\n$’000 $’000\\nGroup\\n31 December 2022\\nFloating rate instruments (1,507) 1,507\\n31 December 2021Floating rate instruments (1,876) 1,876\\nProfit before income \\ntax\\n100 bp 100 bp\\nIncrease Decrease\\n$’000 $’000\\nCompany\\n31 December 2022\\nFloating rate instruments (3,697) 3,697\\n31 December 2021Floating rate instruments (3,766) 3,76635. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONT’D)\\n(a) Credit risk (cont’d) \\nThe Group determined that its financial assets are credit-impaired when:\\n– There are significant financial difficulties of the issuer or the debtor;\\n– A breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;\\n– It is becoming probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial \\nreorganisation; and\\n– There is a disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of \\nfinancial difficulty.\\nThe Group categorises a loan or receivable for potential write-off when a debtor fails to \\nmake contractual payments more than 360 days from the invoice date. Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as debtor failing to engage in a repayment plan with the Group. Where loans and receivables have been written off, the Group continues to engage enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivable due. Where recoveries are made, these are recognised in the income statement.\\nThe following are credit risk management practices and quantitative and qualitative \\ninformation about amounts arising from expected credit losses for each class of financial assets.\\nTrade receivablesThe Group provides for lifetime expected credit losses for all trade receivables using \\na provision matrix. The provision rates are determined based on the Group’s historical observed default rates analysed in accordance to days past due. The expected credit losses incorporate forward looking information such as forecast of economic conditions where the gross domestic product will deteriorate over the next year, leading to an increased number of defaults.\\nThe Group’s exposure to credit risk arises primarily from its diesel engines segment. As at  \\n31 December 2022, the carrying amount of the trade receivables from the top five \\ncustomer groups of the diesel engines segment was $191,365,000 (2021: $43,172,000). This accounted for approximately 39.6% (2021: 20.6%) of the Group’s trade receivables (including trade amounts due from related corporation but excluding bills receivables).

In relation to the derecognition of bill receivable when discounted and endorsed, the management assesses the credit rating of the banks that issued these bills, considers the designated commercial banks by China regulatory are high credit rating and believes that the contractual right to receive the cash flows from the asset have terminated with the Group, but transferred to the banks and suppliers. Accordingly, the respective bill receivable are derecognised, and a discount equal to the difference between the carrying value of the bills receivable and cash received is recorded in the statement of profit or loss. Please refer to Note 15 to the financial statements.\\n(ii)\\n Identifying contract price and performance obligations in sales of engines\\nThe Group provides certain warranties for both general repairs and maintenance service as part of the sales of engines. For general repairs, such warranties will be assurance-type warranty that will continue to be accounted for under SFRS(I) 1-37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets . For maintenance services, \\nit will be accounted for as a service-type warranties that are capable of being distinct and customers can benefit from the service on its own. Hence, the Group identified two separate performance obligations, one is the promise to transfer the engine and the other one is to provide maintenance services after reaching certain on-road mileage or running hours. Consequently, the Group allocated a portion of the transaction price to the engines and the maintenance services based on a combination of expected cost plus margin and residual approaches. Please refer to Note 25 to the financial statements.\\n(iii) Capitalisation of development expenditure\\nDevelopment expenditure are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy \\nin Note 2.13. Capitalisation of development expenditure is based on management’s judgement to determine what constitutes development activities, and when a development project moves from the research phase into development phase. In addition, management’s judgement is required to determine the nature of the expenses that qualify for capitalisation. The carrying amount of development \\nexpenditure capitalised is disclosed in Note 4 to the financial statements.38. SEGMENT INFORMATION (CONT’D)\\nGeographical segments\\nThe Group operations are primarily in the PRC, Singapore and Malaysia.In presenting information on the basis of geographical segments, segment revenue is based \\non the geographical location of customers.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES (CONT’D)\\n(b) Key sources of estimation uncertainty\\nThe key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty \\nat the end of the reporting period are discussed below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.\\nImpairment of property, plant and equipmentAn impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds \\nits recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model. The cash flows do not include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the asset’s performance of the cash-generating unit being tested. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. \\nFurther details of the key assumptions applied in the impairment assessment of property, \\nplant and equipment are disclosed in Note 5 to the financial statements.\\n40. COMPARATIVE FIGURES\\nThe Group enters into contractual arrangements with certain customers that entitle them to sales rebates based on sales volume achieved in the financial year. Management has determined that it is more appropriate to net such sales rebates with the receivables due from these customers in the same financial year. Where receivables have been settled, such sales rebates will then be classified as refund liabilities. Accordingly, the comparative figures in the balance sheet as of 31 December 2021 for trade and other receivables and trade and other payables had been adjusted by $41,439,000 to conform with current year’s presentation.\\nThe changes to 2021 comparatives have no impact on the income statement, net current \\nassets and net assets of the Group.\\n41. AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nThe financial statements of Hong Leong Asia Ltd. for the year ended 31 December 2022 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors passed on  \\n24 March 2023.\\nHONG LEONG ASIA LTD.

In 2023, we intensified our commitment with the implementation of innovative strategies in collaboration with educational institutions as part of our youth engagement initiatives. The dynamism of 2023 was evident as our Learning and Development team effectively orchestrated a diverse array of activities with notable success. These initiatives significantly broadened our knowledge base, contributing to the development of our future talents. Our collaborations with government agencies and educational institutions ensure a continuous enhancement of the workforce within the F&B industry.\\nWe are committed to expand and diversify our \\ndining options to achieve a broader customer base. In March 2023, we introduced Mutiara Seafood, our very first halal seafood dining concept at Wisma Geylang Serai. Mutiara Seafood provides our Malay community with the opportunity to relish the halal rendition of JUMBO Seafood dishes especially that of our famous Singapore Award-winning Chilli Crab.

The revenue of our key brands – JUMBO Seafood and Zui Teochew Cuisine – have recovered to pre- COVID  levels \\nin Singapore.  In addition, our premium brand, JUMBO Signatures, has continued to attract both new and existing diners since its opening in January 2022 at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands.\\nOur business in the PRC saw a slight recovery \\nfollowing the lifting of the zero-COVID policy  in January 2023.  However, the PRC has since entered a phase of subdued growth resulting from a fragile economic recovery.  The challenging economic conditions in Taiwan led to the closure of our JUMBO Kitchen outlet in Taipei City in early 2023.\\nThroughout FY2023, the sudden increase in \\nbusiness activities, coupled with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the delicate bilateral \\nrelationship between the US and PRC, resulted \\nin supply-side challenges such as manpower shortages, disruptions in supplies and escalated costs across multiple facets including salaries, utilities, logistics and borrowings.

This resulted in the publication of a case study in November 2023, aimed at imparting strategic insights into change management and digital transformation strategies within the F&B industry to SMU’s local and international students. Notably, this showcases JUMBO as one of the first few SGX-listed companies to be featured in this manner.\\nFinancial Highlights\\nIn FY2023, the Group delivered a much improved set of performance, largely credited to the relaxation of COVID-19 measures in Singapore. Total revenue surged by 54.7% to reach $178.8 million. Specifically, revenue stemming from our Singapore operations saw a remarkable 78.0% increase to $148.4 million. However, challenges related to the zero-COVID policy in the PRC during the initial half of FY2023 impacted our PRC operations, leading to an overall revenue decline of 6.5% to $26.1 million.\\nPrimarily due to the substantial uptick in business activities \\nwithin our Singapore operations, profit attributable to owners of the Company stood at $14.6 million in FY2023, a significant improvement from the $0.1 million loss reported in FY2022.  Additionally, the EBITDA for FY2023 surged to $37.6 million, marking a noteworthy increase from the $19.4 million recorded in FY2022.\\nDividends\\nGiven our commendable performance in FY2023, the Board has proposed a final tax-exempt (one tier) cash dividend of 1.0 cent per share for FY2023.\\nGoing Forward\\nAs we embark on the new financial year, the Group holds a positive view of our Singapore operations. The relaxation of vaccination-based safety measures and global border openings has rejuvenated our key brands and brought revenues back to pre-COVID levels. Despite this growth, we remain mindful of challenges posed by increased operational expenses, including raw materials, labor, and utilities. While benefiting from eased restrictions locally and internationally, we acknowledge potential hurdles, particularly in the PRC market.

This increase was mainly due to the increase in revenue from our Singapore operations resulting from the lifting of COVID-19 measures. While revenue from the sale of food and beverages increased, the revenue from franchise income decreased as there was no new franchise outlet in FY2023.\\nThe sustained recovery coupled with the strategic \\nconversion of the SuiYi Gastrobar at The Riverwalk into a Jumbo Seafood outlet in January 2023 resulted in the increase in revenue in the Singapore operations. Revenue from our Singapore operations increased by 78.0% or $65.0 million from $83.4 million in FY2022 to $148.4 million in FY2023. \\nFollowing the end of PRC’s zero-COVID policy in \\nDecember 2022, our PRC operations experienced a positive shift with an increase in revenue in 2H2023. However, the zero-COVID policy challenges faced in 1H2023 resulted in an overall decrease in revenue in FY2023 of 6.5% or $1.8 million, from $27.9 million in FY2022 to $26.1 million in FY2023.\\nRevenue for our Taiwan operations increased in 2H2023. \\nThis increase is offset by a decrease in 1H2023 largely due to a three-week shutdown of operations in our Taipei outlet for renovation. As a result, revenue from Taiwan operations remained constant at $4.3 million in FY2022 and FY2023. \\nCost of sales\\nCost of sales increased by 52.1% or $21.1 million, from $40.6 million in FY2022 to $61.7 million in FY2023. This increase is in-line with the increase in revenue. \\nGross profit\\nGross profit increased by 56.1% or $42.0 million, from $75.0 million in FY2022 to $117.0 million in FY2023. Despite the decrease in gross profit margin in 2H2023 compared to 2H2022, gross profit margin increased by 0.6 percentage point from 64.9% in FY2022 to 65.5% in FY2023. Other income\\nOther income increased by 124.9% or $2.8 million, from $2.2 million in FY2022 to $5.0 million in FY2023. This is mainly due to an increase in government grants and credit scheme, fair value gains on investments at FVTPL and on short-term investments recognised.\\nEmployee benefits expenses\\nEmployee benefits expenses increased by 52.8% or $19.5 million from $36.9 million in FY2022 to $56.4 million in FY2023. This increase in employee benefit expenses is mainly due to increases in headcount to support the increases in revenue, basic pay and bonuses.  \\nOperating lease expenses\\nOperating lease expenses increased by 49.0% or $1.5 million from $3.0 million in FY2022 to $4.5 million in FY2023. This increase is due to higher variable rent resulting from higher revenue.\\nUtilities expenses\\nUtilities expenses increased by 31.9% or $1.2 million from $3.9 million in FY2022 to $5.1 million in FY2023. This increase is due to the increase in revenue and higher utility rates. \\nDepreciation and amortisation\\nDepreciation for property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) decreased by 3.7% or $0.2 million from $5.8 million in FY2022 to $5.6 million in FY2023 mainly due to the increase in fully depreciated PPE in FY2023.\\nDepreciation expense for right-of-use (“ ROU”) assets \\nincreased by 2.2% or $0.3 million from $11.8 million \\nin FY2022 to $12.1 million in FY2023. The increases in depreciation expense for ROU are due to renewal of leases and one new outlet. \\nInterest expense\\nInterest expense for leases remained unchanged at $1.0 million in FY2022 and FY2023.\\nInterest expense for loans increased by 20.0% or $0.1 \\nmillion, from $0.4 million in FY2022 to $0.5 million in FY2023. The increases are due to a mortgage loan being drawn down in December 2022, partially offset by repayment of bank loans. Other operating expenses \\nOther operating expenses increased by 27.0% or $3.9 million from $14.2 million in FY2022 to $18.1 million in FY2023. These increases are in-line with the general increase in business activities.\\nIncome tax expense\\nThe income tax expense of $4.2 million in FY2023 was recognised mainly due to the Singapore operations returning to a taxable position. \\nProfit attributable to owners of the Company \\nFor FY2023, profit attributable to owners of the Company stood at $14.6 million compared to a loss of $0.1 million in FY2022.\\nREVIEW OF THE GROUP’S FINANCIAL POSITION\\nCurrent assets\\nThe Group’s current assets increased by $22.9 million to \\n$72.4 million as at 30 September 2023, largely due to (i) an increase in short-term investments of $7.6 million, as the Group placed cash generated from operations and funds from bank borrowings to bank managed funds to generate returns to offset interest expense;  \\n(ii) an increase in inventories of $0.2 million; and (iii) an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $16.6 million from operations during the year; and partially offset by a decrease in trade and other receivables of $1.5 million.\\nNon-current assets\\nThe Group’s non-current assets increased by $1.7 million to $59.3 million as at 30 September 2023, largely due to an increase in PP&E of $3.8 million mainly due to the acquisition of a property for restaurant operations and renovations for a few outlets during the year; and partially offset by a decrease in deferred tax assets of $1.9 million due to utilization of tax losses brought forward from prior years.\\nCurrent liabilities\\nThe Group’s current liabilities increased by $12.2 million to $45.0 million as at 30 September 2023 mainly due to (i) an increase in trade and other payables of $9.0 million mainly due to higher business activities during the year; (ii) an increase in income tax payable of $2.0 million due to higher profits in FY2023; (iii) an increase in lease liabilities of $0.7 million due to the signing of new lease for Mutiara Seafood outlet and lease renewals; and  \\n(iv) an increase in bank borrowings of $0.3 million due to the drawdown of a mortgage loan to fund the acquisition of a property.\\nNon-current liabilities\\nThe Group’s non-current liabilities decreased marginally by $0.9 million to $26.8 million as at 30 September 2023.\\nREVIEW OF THE GROUP’S CASH FLOW STATEMENT\\nThe Group generated net cash from operating activities before movements in working capital of $37.3 million in FY2023. Net cash generated from operations amounted to $47.2 million due to a decrease in trade and other receivables of $1.0 million, an increase in trade and other payables of $9.0 million and slightly offset by an increase in inventories of $0.2 million. Including the $1.6 million paid for interest and income tax and  \\n$0.6 million interest income received, net cash generated from operating activities were $46.2 million in FY2023.\\nNet cash used in investing activities amounted to $17.3 \\nmillion mainly due to (i) an acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $10.0 million, of which $5.5 million was for the acquisition of a property for restaurant operations, while the remaining was for renovations for our new Mutiara Seafood outlet at Wisma Geylang Serai and existing outlets, namely the JUMBO Seafood outlets at IFC in Shanghai, and at The Riverwalk and Dempsey in Singapore; (ii) $7.4 million deployed to short-term investments to generate returns to offset interest expense on bank borrowings.\\nNet cash used in financing activities for FY2023 of \\n$12.9 million was mainly due to the repayment of lease obligations of $13.0 million, repayment of bank \\nborrowings of $4.0 million and the repurchase of treasury \\nshares that amounted to $0.3 million partially offset by the drawdown of a $4.4 million mortgage loan for the acquisition of a property for restaurant operations.\\nAs a result, cash and cash equivalents increased by \\n$16.0 million during the financial year to $33.7 million as at 30 September 2023.FINANCIAL \\nHIGHLIGHTSFINANCIAL \\nHIGHLIGHTS'),\n",

The Board is constituted as follows:\\nMr. Tan Cher Liang  (Independent Chairman)\\nMr. Ang Kiam Meng  (Group CEO and Executive Director) \\nMdm. Tan Yong Chuan, Jacqueline  (Executive Director)\\nMrs. Christina Kong Chwee Huan  (Executive Director and COO) \\nDr. Lim Boh Soon  (Independent Director) \\nMr. Richard Tan Kheng Swee  (Independent Director)\\nMs. Sim Yu Juan Rachel  (Non-Executive Director)\\nAs three (3) out of seven (7) members of the Board are Independent Directors, there is a strong independent element on the Board and no individual or small group of individuals dominate the Board’s decision-making process. In addition, the Board has an Independent Chairman, Mr. Tan Cher Liang. The Non-Executive Directors make up a majority of the Board. \\nEach year, the Board reviews its size and composition, taking into account, inter alia, the Board Diversity Policy \\nimplemented by the Company. Key considerations in the Board Diversity Policy include the scope and nature of the \\nGroup’s business and operations and the benefits of all aspects of diversity, including but not limited to gender, age, educational background and professional experience in order to provide the Board access to an appropriate range and balance of skills, knowledge, experience and backgrounds. The Board is of the view that the Directors hold core competencies such as accounting, finance and legal expertise, business and management experience, industry knowledge, strategic planning experience and customer-based experience and knowledge. The Board has also agreed to adopt a gender diversity target that is aligned with the gender diversity target set by the Council for Board Diversity (“ CBD”). The CBD advocates for women board representation of 25% by 2025 and 30% by \\n2030. At present, the Board has two (2) female Executive Directors, namely Mdm. Tan Yong Chuan, Jacqueline and Mrs. Christina Kong Chwee Huan, and one (1) female Non-Executive Director, namely Ms. Sim Yu Juan Rachel. The Company will maintain at least 25% women representation on its Board until 2025 and review the targeted representation in due course. \\nThe Board has also assessed that its diversity profile in terms of skills and knowledge are adequate to support \\nthe Company’s strategic objectives. The Independent Directors and Non-Executive Director contribute accounting and finance knowledge, legal expertise and business management experience to the Group, and provide the Executive Directors and the Management with diverse and objective perspectives on issues considered by the Board. The Independent Directors and Non-Executive Director also aid in developing the Group’s strategic process, reviewing the performance of the Management in meeting agreed goals and objectives, and monitoring the reporting of performance and operations as an appropriate check and balance. The Independent Directors and/or Non-Executive Director meet regularly on their own without the presence of the Executive Directors and the Management and provide feedback to the Group CEO after such meetings.Hence, the Board believes that its current composition provides an appropriate balance of skills, experience, gender and knowledge, which guards against groupthink and fosters robust discussions, which in turn leads to better decision-making.\\nBoard IndependenceThe independence of each Director is reviewed by the NC on an annual basis. In determining whether a Director \\nis independent, the NC has considered the guidelines set out in the Code and the Catalist Rules.\\nThe Code has defined an “independent” director as one who is independent in conduct, character and \\njudgement, and has no relationship with the company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the director’s independent business judgement in the best interests of the company. \\nUnder Rule 406(3)(d) of the Catalist Rules, a director will not be independent under any of the following \\ncircumstances:\\nl if he is employed or has been employed by the Company or any of its related corporations in the current or \\nany of the past three (3) financial years; \\nl if he has an immediate family member who is employed or has been employed by the Company or any of its \\nrelated corporations in the current or any of the past three (3) financial years, and whose remuneration is or was determined by the RC; or\\nl if he has been a director of the Company for an aggregate period of more than 9 years (whether before or \\nafter listing).\\nThe Directors complete an annual declaration of independence, whereby they are required to assess their independence taking into account the Code, its accompanying Practice Guidance and the above requirements, which is then put to the NC for review. The Directors are also required to disclose any business relationships with the Company, its related corporations or its officers which may interfere with, the exercise of their independent business judgment in the best interests of the Company, or would otherwise deem them to be not independent. Following its annual review, the Board and the NC are of the view that Mr. Tan Cher Liang, Dr. Lim Boh Soon and Mr. Richard Tan Kheng Swee are independent.\\nAt present, there are no Independent Directors who has served beyond nine (9) years since the date of his first \\nappointment. Our Independent Directors, Mr. Tan Cher Liang, Dr. Lim Boh Soon and Mr. Richard Tan Kheng Swee, will reach the nine year limit of their tenure in October 2024. To be in compliance with Rule 406(3)(d)(iv), Dr. Lim Boh Soon and Mr. Richard Tan Kheng Swee have decided to retire and not seek re-election at the forthcoming AGM of the Company. The Board is cognizant of the requirements of the Catalist Rules and the Code, and is in the midst of finding a new Independent Director. The Company will release the announcement regarding the appointment of the new Independent Director in due course.\\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nPrinciple 3: There is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board \\nand Management, and no one individual has unfettered powers of decision-making.\\nThe Company has a separate Chairman and Group CEO. This ensures that there is an appropriate balance of power, increased accountability and greater capacity of the Board for independent decision-making. The Chairman and Group CEO are not related to each other. '),\n",

Nevertheless, the Board tasked the NC to review if a Director with multiple board representations is devoting sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Group. The NC has reviewed each Director’s directorships and principal commitments as well as each Director’s attendance and contributions to the Board. Despite the multiple directorships of some Directors, the NC is satisfied that the Directors spent adequate time and attention on the Company’s affairs and have diligently discharged their responsibilities. In addition, each Director has confirmed that notwithstanding other listed company board representations and other principal commitments (if any), he/she is able to devote sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Group.

All Directors submit themselves for re-nomination and re-election at regular intervals in accordance with the Constitution. Pursuant to Regulation 89 of the Constitution, one-third of the Board are to retire from office by rotation and be subject to re-election at the AGM of the Company.

The Board acts on the feedback and in consultation with the NC, proposes, where appropriate, new Directors to be appointed or seeks the resignation of Directors. \\nEach Director will evaluate the performance of the Board taking into account a set of objective performance \\ncriteria recommended by the NC which includes, inter alia , Board composition and size, Shareholders’ access \\nto information, Board processes, Board effectiveness, Board standards of conduct and financial performance indicators. The Board is of the view that this set of performance criteria allows for appropriate comparison and addresses how the Directors have enhanced long-term Shareholders’ value. For FY2023, the NC is of the view that the Board has fared well against the performance criteria and objectives and the NC is satisfied with the performance of the Board. The NC did not engage any external facilitator to assist with the assessment of the Board’s performance for FY2023.\\nIndividual Director EvaluationThe NC will assess each Director’s contribution to the effectiveness of the Board. In evaluating the contribution \\nby each Director, various factors will be taken into consideration, including individual performance of principal functions and fiduciary duties, attendance and participation in meetings and commitment of time to Director’s duties. The NC will also consider other contributions by a Director such as providing objective perspectives on issues, facilitating business opportunities and strategic relationships, and the Director’s accessibility to the Management outside of formal Board and/or Board Committee meetings.

All \\nthe RC members, including the Chairman, are Independent Directors. The RC holds at least one (1) meeting in each financial year.

No Director is involved in deciding his/her own remuneration.\\nThe RC also reviews all aspects of remuneration, including the Company’s obligations, if any, arising in the event \\nof termination of the Executive Directors’ and/or key management personnel’s contracts, to ensure that the terms are fair and reasonable. Currently, save as required for compliance with the applicable laws of Singapore and the People’s Republic of China (“ PRC”), the Group has not set aside any amounts to provide for pension, retirement \\nor similar benefits for the Group’s employees.Remuneration Policies\\nIn order to maximise Shareholders’ value and promote the long-term success of the Group, the Company seeks \\nto attract, retain and motivate the Management and employees by tailoring competitive remuneration packages to the specific role and circumstances of each Director, the Group CEO and key management personnel.

Our responsibilities under \\nthose standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements  \\nsection of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities  \\n(“ACRA Code ”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in \\nSingapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\\nKey Audit Matters\\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.'),\n",

The Group operates \\noutlets in Singapore, China and Taiwan. \\nThe Group has certain restaurant outlets that \\nincurred losses during the financial year ended  \\n30 September 2023. Management performed \\nimpairment assessment on the property, plant and \\nequipment and right-of-use assets of these outlets. Management determined the recoverable amounts of the property, plant and equipment and right-\\nof-use assets of these outlets based on value-in-\\nuse calculations and recorded an impairment loss \\nof $410,000. This area was significant to our audit because the impairment assessment involved significant management judgement and required the management to make various assumptions including the revenue growth rates and discount rates used in the \\nunderlying discounted cash flow forecasts.\\nThe Group’s disclosure on property, plant and \\nequipment and right-of-use assets is set out in Notes 3(c), 16 and 17 to the financial statements respectively.We performed procedures to evaluate the design and implementation of the relevant controls management has over the impairment review analysis.\\n \\nWe involved our valuation specialist to assess the valuation method used by the management and evaluated the key assumptions used in the impairment assessment, in particular the revenue growth rates and \\ndiscount rates.\\nWe tested the robustness of management’s budgeting \\nprocess by comparing the actual financial performance against previously forecasted results.\\nWe compared the revenue growth rates of the  \\nnon-performing outlets to the recent performance and \\nmarket expectations. We also reviewed management’s sensitivity analysis of the carrying amounts of property, \\nplant and equipment and right-of-use assets to \\nchanges in certain key assumptions such as revenue \\ngrowth rates and discount rates.\\nBased on the outcome of the impairment assessment, \\nthe recoverable amounts of the property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets of certain loss-making \\noutlets based on value-in-use calculations were \\nlower than the carrying amounts as at the end of the \\nreporting period and the shortfall was recorded as impairment loss in profit or loss. \\nIn addition, we assessed the adequacy of the \\ndisclosures on the property, plant and equipment and \\nright-of-use assets in Notes 3(c), 16 and 17 to the financial statements respectively.\\nInformation Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report \\nThereon\\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in \\nthe Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.\\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of \\nassurance conclusion thereon.\\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, \\nin doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have \\nperformed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report \\nthat fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements\\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance \\nwith the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair view financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.\\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as \\na going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\\nThe directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free \\nfrom material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional \\nscepticism throughout the audit. We also:\\n(a) Identif y and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud \\nor error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\\n(b) Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that \\nare appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.\\n(c) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates \\nand related disclosures made by management.\\n(d) Conclude on the appropriateness of management ’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, \\nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions \\nthat may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude \\nthat a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\\n(e) E valuate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the \\ndisclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.'),\n",

The Company is \\nlisted on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“ SGX-ST ”). The consolidated financial \\nstatements are expressed in Singapore dollars.\\n The principal activity of the Company is that of investment holding .\\n The principal activities of the subsidiaries and associates are disclosed in Notes 10 and 11 to the financial \\nstatements respectively.\\n The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position and statement of \\nchanges in equity of the Company for the year ended 30 September 2023 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 4 January 2024.\\n2 SUMMAR Y OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\n BASIS OF A CCOUNTING - The financial statements have been prepared in accordance on the historical cost \\nbasis, except as disclosed in the accounting policies below, and are drawn up in accordance with the provisions \\n of the Companies Act 1967 and Singapore F inancial Reporting Standards (International) (“ SFRS(I)s”).\\n Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and \\nservices.\\n F air value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly \\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability which  \\nmarket participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of SFRS(I) 2 Share-based Payment , leasing transactions that are within the scope of SFRS(I) 16 Leases , \\nand measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in SFRS(I) 1-2 Inventories  or value-in-use in SFRS(I) 1-36 Impairment of Assets.\\n In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 \\nbased on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:\\n l L evel 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the \\nentity can access at the measurement date;\\n l L evel 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the \\nasset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and\\n l L evel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.2 SUMMAR Y OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)\\n ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED ST ANDARDS – On 1 October 2022, the Group and the Company \\nadopted all the new and revised SFRS(I) pronouncements that are relevant to its operations. The adoption of these new/ revised SFRS(I) pronouncements does not result in changes to the Group’s and the Company’s accounting policies and has no material effect on the amounts reported for the current or prior years.\\n BASIS OF COMBINA TION - In 2015, the financial statements incorporated the financial statements of the \\nCompany and its subsidiaries and had been prepared using the principles of merger accounting and on the assumption that the re-organisation of entities controlled by the same shareholders collectively had been effected as at the beginning of the earliest period presented in these financial statements.\\n Under merger accounting , the assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows and all the entities \\nwithin the Group are combined after making such adjustments as are necessary to achieve consistency of accounting policies. This manner of presentation reflects the economic enterprise, although the legal parent-subsidiary relationship between the Company and the subsidiaries was not established until  \\n9 November 2015.\\n Where necessary , adjustments are made to the financial statements of the Group entities to bring their \\naccounting policies in line with those used by other members of the Group.\\n All significant intercompany transactions and balances between Group enterprises are eliminated on  \\ncombination.\\n \\n BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements \\nof the Company and entities (including structured entities) controlled by the Company and its subsidiaries. Control is achieved when the Company:\\n\\tl  Has power over the investee;\\n\\tl  Is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and\\n\\tl  Has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.\\n The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there \\nare changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.\\n When the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the  \\ninvestee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the Company’s voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including:\\n\\tl  The size of the Company ’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the \\nother vote holders;\\n\\tl  P otential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties;\\n\\tl  Rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and\\n\\tl  Any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Company has, or does not have, the  \\ncurrent ability to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders’ meetings.'),\n",

Specifically, the results of subsidiaries acquired or \\ndisposed of during the year are included in profit or loss from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.\\n N on-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Those \\ninterest of non-controlling shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation may initially be measured at fair value or at the  \\nnon-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity.  \\n P rofit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the \\nCompany and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\\n When neces sary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring its accounting \\npolicies in line with the Group’s accounting policies.\\n All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity , income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between \\nthe members of the Group are eliminated on consolidation.\\n In the Company ’s separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries and associates are carried at \\ncost less any impairment in net recoverable value that has been recognised in profit or loss.\\n FINANC IAL INSTRUMENTS – Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s \\nstatement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.\\n All financial assets are recognised and de-recognised on a trade date basis where the purchase or sale of \\nfinancial assets is under a contract whose terms require delivery of assets within the time frame established by the market concerned. \\n Financial assets  \\n All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair \\nvalue, depending on the classification of the financial assets.\\n Classification of financial assets\\n Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are measured subsequently at amortised cost:\\n\\tl  the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to \\ncollect contractual cash flows; and\\n\\tl  the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely \\npayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.2 SUMMAR Y OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)\\n Classification of financial assets  (cont’d)\\n Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at fair value through other \\ncomprehensive income (FVTOCI):\\n\\tl  the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting  \\ncontractual cash flows and selling the financial assets; and\\n\\tl  the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely \\npayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\\n By default, all other financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).\\n Despite the foregoing , the Group may make the following irrevocable election/designation at initial \\nrecognition of a financial asset:\\n l the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value of an equity investment in \\nother comprehensive income if certain criteria are met; and\\n l the Group may irrevocably designate a debt investment that meets the amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria \\nas measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch.\\n Amortised cost and effective interest method\\n The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of  \\nallocating interest income over the relevant period.\\n F or financial assets other than purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets (i.e. assets that are \\ncredit-impaired on initial recognition), the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) excluding expected credit losses, through the expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the gross carrying amount of the debt instrument on initial recognition.\\n The amor tised cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial \\nrecognition minus the principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any loss allowance.\\n Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method for debt instruments measured subsequently \\nat amortised cost and at FVTOCI.

These debt \\ninstruments are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, changes in the carrying \\namount of these debt instruments as a result of foreign exchange gains and losses, impairment gains or losses, and interest income calculated using the effective interest method are recognised in profit or loss. The amounts that are recognised in profit or loss are the same as the amounts that would have been recognised in profit or loss if these debt instruments had been measured at amortised cost. All other changes in the carrying amount of these debt instruments are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of investments revaluation reserve. When these debt instruments are derecognised, the cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.\\n Financial assets at FVTPL\\n F inancial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI are \\nmeasured at FVTPL. Specifically:\\n\\tl  Investments in equity instruments are classified as at FVTPL , unless the Group designates an equity \\ninvestment that is neither held for trading nor a contingent consideration arising from a business combination as at FVTOCI on initial recognition.\\n\\tl  Debt instruments that do not meet the amortised cost criteria or the FVT OCI criteria are classified as at \\nFVTPL. In addition, debt instruments that meet either the amortised cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases. The Group has not designated any debt instruments as at FVTPL.\\n F inancial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value as at the end of each reporting period, with any fair \\nvalue gains or losses recognised in profit or loss to the extent they are not part of a designated hedging relationship. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss includes any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset and is included in the “other income” line item (Note 28). Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 4(c)(vi).\\n Foreign exchange gains and losses\\n The carrying amount of financial assets that are denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that \\nforeign currency and translated at the spot rate as at the end of each reporting period. Specifically,\\n l for financial assets measured at amortised cost that are not part of a designated hedging relationship, \\nexchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the “other income” or “other operating expenses” line item; \\n l f or debt instruments measured at FVTOCI that are not part of a designated hedging relationship, \\nexchange differences on the amortised cost of the debt instrument are recognised in profit or loss in the “other income” or “other operating expenses” line item; and\\n l for financial assets measured at FVTPL that are not part of a designated hedging relationship, exchange \\ndifferences are recognised in profit or loss in the “other income” or “other operating expenses” line item.2 SUMMAR Y OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)\\n Impairment of financial assets\\n The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses (“ ECL”) on investments in debt instruments \\n that are measured at FVT OCI. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at the end of each reporting \\nperiod to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument.\\n The Group always recognises lifetime ECL for trade receivables. The expected credit losses on these  \\nfinancial assets are estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date, including time value of money where appropriate.\\n F or all other financial assets, the Group recognises lifetime ECL when there has been a significant increase \\nin credit risk since initial recognition. If the credit risk on the financial asset has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial asset at an amount equal to 12-month ECL. The assessment of whether lifetime ECL should be recognised is based on significant increases in the likelihood or risk of a default occurring since initial recognition instead of on evidence of a financial asset being credit-impaired at the reporting date or an actual default occurring.\\n Lifetime ECL represents the expected credit losses that will result from all possible default events  \\nover the expected life of a financial asset. In contrast, 12-month ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events on a financial asset that are possible within  \\n12 months after the reporting date.\\n Significant increase in credit risk\\n In assessing whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial  \\nrecognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the date of initial recognition. In making this assessment, the Group considers both quantitative and qualitative information that is reasonable and supportable, including historical experience and forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort. Forward-looking information considered includes the future prospects of the industries in which the Group’s debtors operate, obtained from economic expert reports, financial analysts, governmental bodies, relevant think-tanks and other similar organisations, as well as consideration of various external sources of actual and forecast economic information that relate to the Group’s core operations.\\n In particular , the following information is taken into account when assessing whether credit risk has \\nincreased significantly since initial recognition:\\n\\tl  existing or forecast adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to \\ncause a significant decrease in the debtor’s ability to meet its debt obligations;\\n\\tl  an actual or expected significant deterioration in the operating results of the debtor; and\\n\\tl  an actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory , economic, or technological \\nenvironment of the debtor that results in a significant decrease in the debtor’s ability to meet its debt obligations.'),\n",

A financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk if i) the financial instrument has a low risk of default, ii) the borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term and iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfill its contractual cash flow obligations.\\n The Group regularly  monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify whether there has been a \\nsignificant increase in credit risk and revises them as appropriate to ensure that the criteria are capable of identifying significant increase in credit risk before the amount becomes past due.\\n Definition of default\\n The Group considers the information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates  \\nthat the debtor is unlikely to pay its creditors, including the Group, in full (without taking into account any collaterals held by the Group) as constituting an event of default for internal credit risk management purposes as historical experience indicates that receivables that meet either of the following criteria are generally not recoverable.\\n Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is \\nmore than 90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate.\\n Credit-impaired financial assets\\n A f inancial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on \\nthe estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is  \\ncredit-impaired includes observable data about the following events:\\n a)  significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower; or\\n b)  a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event; or\\n c)  the lender(s) of the borrower , for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower’s financial \\ndifficulty, having granted to the borrower a concession(s) that the lender(s) would not otherwise consider; or\\n d)  it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation.2 SUMMAR Y OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)\\n Write-off policy\\n The Group writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the counterparty is in severe \\nfinancial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the counterparty has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings, or in the case of trade receivables, when the amounts are over two years past due, whichever occurs sooner. Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Group’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss.\\n Measurement and recognition of expected credit losses\\n The measurement of expected credit losses is a function of the probability of default, loss given default   \\n(i.e. the magnitude of the loss if there is a default) and the exposure at default. The assessment of the probability of default and loss given default is based on historical data adjusted by forward-looking information as described above. As for the exposure at default, for financial assets, this is represented by the assets’ gross carrying amount at the reporting date; for loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts, the exposure includes the amount drawn down as at the reporting date, together with any additional amounts expected to be drawn down in the future by default date determined based on historical trend, the Group’s understanding of the specific future financing needs of the debtors, and other relevant forward-looking information.\\n F or financial assets, the expected credit loss is estimated as the difference between all contractual cash flows \\nthat are due to the Group in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate.\\n If the Group has measured the loss allowance for a financial asset at an amount equal to lifetime ECL  \\nin the previous reporting period, but determines at the current reporting date that the conditions for lifetime ECL are no longer met, the Group measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to  \\n12-month ECL at the current reporting date, except for assets for which the simplified approach was used. \\n The Group recognises an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss for all financial assets with a  \\ncorresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account, except for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, for which the loss allowance is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the investment revaluation reserve, and does not reduce the carrying amount of the financial asset in the statement of financial position. \\n Derecognition of financial assets\\n The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset \\nexpire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.'),\n",

In contrast, on derecognition of an investment in equity instrument which the Group has elected on initial recognition to measure at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the investments revaluation reserve is not reclassified to profit or loss. \\n Financial liabilities and equity instruments\\n Classification as debt or equity\\n Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or equity in accordance with the  \\nsubstance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.\\n Equity instruments\\n An equity instrument is any contract that ev idences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after \\ndeducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\\n R epurchase of the Company’s own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity. No gain \\nor loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments. \\n \\n Trade and other payables\\n T rade and other payables are measured subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, \\nexcept for short-term balances when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.\\n Bank borrowings\\n Interest -bearing bank borrowings are measured subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest \\nmethod. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for borrowing costs (see below).\\n Derecognition of financial liabilities\\n The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, \\ncancelled or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss. 2 SUMMAR Y OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)\\n Offsetting arrangements\\n F inancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of \\nfinancial position when the Company and the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts; and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. A right to set-off must be available today rather than being contingent on a future event and must be exercisable by any of the counterparties, both in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.\\n Foreign exchange gains and losses\\n F or financial liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency and are measured at amortised cost as \\nat each reporting date, the foreign exchange gains and losses are determined based on the amortised cost of the instruments. These foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the “other income” or “other operating expenses” line item in profit or loss.\\n The fair value of financial liabilities denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency \\nand translated at the spot rate at the end of the reporting period.\\n LEASES\\n The Group as lessee\\n The G roup assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of the contract. The Group \\nrecognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease arrangements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed. \\n The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at  \\nthe commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lessee. The rate is defined as the rate of interest that the lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term and with a similar security the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment.\\n L ease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise: \\n\\tl  fixed lease payments (including in- substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives; and\\n\\tl  variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at \\nthe commencement date.\\n The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the statement of financial position. \\n The leas e liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the \\nlease liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made.

They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. \\n Whenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site \\non which it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, a provision is recognised and measured under SFRS(I) 1-37. To the extent that the costs relate to a right-of-use asset, the costs are included in the related right-of-use asset, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories. \\n Right -of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the  \\nright-of-use asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease. \\n The right -of-use assets are presented as a separate line in the statement of financial position. \\n The Group applies SFRS(I) 1-36 to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any \\nidentified impairment loss. \\n V ariable rents that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease \\nliability and the right-of-use asset. The related payments are recognised as an expense in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs and are included in the line ‘operating lease expenses’ in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. \\n As a practical expedient, SFRS(I) 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead \\naccount for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Group has used this practical expedient. 2 SUMMAR Y OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)\\n LEASES (cont ’d)\\n The Group as lessee  (cont’d)\\n The Group had applied the practical expedient which permits a lessee to elect not to assess whether a  \\nCOVID-19-related rent concession is a lease modification and accordingly has accounted for any change in lease payments resulting from the COVID-19-related rent concessions applying SFRS(I) 16 as if the change were not a lease modification. \\n INVENT ORIES - Inventories comprising mainly food and beverages are stated at the lower of cost  \\nand net realisable value.  Cost comprises all cost of purchase and overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.  Cost is calculated using the  \\nfirst-in-first-out method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.\\n PROPER TY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated \\ndepreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\\n F reehold property is not depreciated. \\n Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets over their estimated useful lives, \\nother than plant and equipment under work in progress, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:\\n Audio, visual and office equipment  -  3 to 10 years\\n Kitchen equipment and utensils  -  3 to 10 years\\n F urniture and fittings  -  3 to 10 years\\n R enovation  -  3 to 10 years\\n L easehold industrial properties  -  44 to 50 years\\n Motor vehicles  -  10 years\\n The es timated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each \\nreporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.\\n W ork in progress relates to kitchen equipment and renovation.

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration \\ntransferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the acquiree over net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.'),\n",

For the purpose of impairment \\ntesting, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the \\nsynergies of the combination.   Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for \\nimpairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.   If the \\nrecoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other \\nassets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.   An impairment loss \\nrecognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.\\n On dispos al of a subsidiary or the relevant cash generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is \\nincluded in the determination of profit or loss on disposal.\\n INT ANGIBLE ASSETS – Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are identified and recognised \\nseparately from goodwill. The cost of such intangible assets is their fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately. \\n In tangible assets with finite useful lives (franchise rights) are amortised on a straight-line basis over \\ntheir estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed as at each reporting date, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (trademark) that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses and is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.\\n Amortisation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful life of 10 years using \\nthe straight-line method.\\n An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from \\nuse or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised. \\n IMP AIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL - At each reporting date, \\nthe Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.  If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).  Where the asset does not generate cash flows independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable  \\nand consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual  \\ncash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.2 SUMMAR Y OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)\\n R ecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. In assessing  \\nvalue-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\\n If  the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying \\namount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.  \\nAn impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\\n W here an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating \\nunit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years.  A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss to the extent that it eliminates the impairment loss which has been recognised for the asset in prior years.\\n ASSOCIA TES - An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence \\nis the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\\n T he results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial \\nstatements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment, or a portion thereof, is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with SFRS(I) 5 Non-current Assets \\nHeld for Sale and Discontinued Operations . Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is \\nrecognised initially in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate. When the Group’s share of losses of an associate exceeds the Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate), the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.\\n An investment in an associate is accounted for using the equity method from the date on which the investee \\nbecomes an associate. On acquisition of the investment in an associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.\\n The requirements of SFRS(I) 1-36 are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognise any  \\nimpairment loss with respect to the Group’s investment in an associate. When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with SFRS(I) 1-36 as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value-in-use and fair value less costs of disposal) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognised is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with SFRS(I) 1-36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.'),\n",

When the Group retains an interest in the \\nformer associate and the retained interest is a financial asset, the Group measures the retained interest at fair value at that date and the fair value is regarded as its fair value on initial recognition in accordance with SFRS(I) 9. The difference between the carrying amount of the associate at the date the equity method was discontinued, and the fair value of any retained interest and any proceeds from disposing of a part interest in the associate is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal of the associate. In addition, the Group accounts for all amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate on the same basis as would be required if that associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. Therefore, if a gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income by that associate would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities, the Group reclassifies the gain or loss from equity to profit or loss (as a reclassification adjustment) when the associate is disposed of.\\n The Group continues to use the equity method when an investment in an associate becomes an investment \\nin a joint venture or an investment in a joint venture becomes an investment in an associate. There is no remeasurement to fair value upon such changes in ownership interests.\\n When the Group reduces its ownership interest in an associate but the Group continues to use the equity \\nmethod, the Group reclassifies to profit or loss the proportion of the gain or loss that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that reduction in ownership interest if that gain or loss would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities.\\n When a Group entity transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses resulting from the  \\ntransactions with the associate are recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate that are not related to the Group.\\n PRO VISIONS - Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as \\na result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\\n The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present \\nobligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.  Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material).\\n When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered  \\nfrom a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.\\n Provision for reinstatement costs\\n The Group recognises a liability if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to reinstate  \\nthe leased premises to their original state upon expiry of the lease. The provision is made based on management’s best estimate of the expected costs to be incurred to reinstate the leased premises to their original state. 2 SUMMAR Y OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)\\n SHARE -BASED PAYMENTS - The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. \\nEquity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value of the equity instruments at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-settled employee benefits reserve.\\n TREASUR Y SHARES - The Group’s own equity instruments, which are reacquired (treasury shares) \\nare recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. Any difference between the carrying amount of treasury shares and the consideration received, if reissued, is recognised directly in equity. Voting rights related to treasury shares are nullified for the Group and no dividends are allocated to them respectively.\\n GO VERNMENT GRANTS - Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that \\nthe Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and the grants will be received. Government grants whose primary condition is that the Group should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire  \\nnon-current assets are recognised as deferred income in the statement of financial position and transferred to profit or loss on a systematic and rational basis over the useful lives of the related assets.\\n Other government grants are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the costs \\nfor which they are intended to compensate, on a systematic basis. Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the Group with no future related costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they become receivable.\\n REVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects \\nto be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. \\n R evenue is recognised when the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good \\nor service to a customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service. A performance obligation may be satisfied at a point in time or over time. The amount of revenue recognised is the amount allocated to the satisfied performance obligation.\\n Sale of food and beverages\\n R evenue from the sale of food and beverages is recognised at a point in time which is usually upon the \\ndelivery of goods to customers.\\n Franchise and royalty income\\n Initial franchise income is recognised at the point in time upon the grant of rights, completion of the  \\ndesignated phases of the franchise setup and transfer of know-how to the franchisee in accordance with the terms stated in the franchise agreement. Royalty income is recognised over time as a percentage of the franchisees’ revenue in accordance with terms as stated in the franchise agreement.'),\n",

Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes, such as \\nthe Singapore Central Provident Fund, are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the \\nGroup’s obligations under the plans are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement \\nbenefit plan.\\n EMPL OYEE LEAVE ENTITLEMENT - Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they \\naccrue to employees.   A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services \\nrendered by employees up to the end of the reporting period.\\n CL UB MEMBERSHIP - This comprises of investment in club membership which is stated at cost less any \\nimpairment in net recoverable value that has been recognised in profit or loss.\\n INCOME T AX - Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\\n Th e tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as \\nreported in profit or loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible \\nin other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for \\ncurrent tax is calculated using tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted in \\ncountries where the Company and subsidiaries operate by the end of the reporting period.\\n Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts \\nof assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation \\nof taxable profit, and is accounted for using the liability method.  Deferred tax liabilities are generally \\nrecognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that \\nit is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be \\nutilised.  Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a \\ntransaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.2 SUMMAR Y OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)\\n Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries \\nand associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is \\nprobable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.   Deferred tax assets arising \\nfrom deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.\\n The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that \\nit is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\\n Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled \\nor the asset realised based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequence that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.\\n Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax  \\nassets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\\n Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are  \\nrecognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination. \\n FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSA CTIONS AND TRANSLATIONS - The individual financial statements of \\neach Group entity are measured and presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in \\nwhich the entity operates (its functional currency).   The consolidated financial statements of the Group and \\nthe statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity of the Company are presented in Singapore dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.\\n In preparing the financial statements of the Group ’s entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s \\nfunctional currency (foreign currency) are recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing on the dates of \\nthe transactions.   At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign \\ncurrencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.  Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the \\nfair value was determined.   Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign \\ncurrency are not retranslated.\\n Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on retranslation of monetary \\nitems are included in profit or loss for the period.   Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of  \\nnon-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.

For all other partial disposals (i.e. of associates or jointly controlled entities that do not result in the Group losing significant influence or joint control), the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to profit or loss.\\n On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities \\n(including monetary items that, in substance, form part of the net investment in foreign entities), and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity under the header of currency translation reserve.\\n Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets \\nand liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.\\n MERGER RESERVE - Merger reserve represents the difference between the nominal amount of the share  \\ncapital of the subsidiaries at the date on which it was acquired by the Company and the amount of the share capital issued as consideration for the acquisition.\\n CASH AND CASH EQUIV ALENTS IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS - Cash and cash equivalents in \\nthe statement of cash flows comprise cash at bank and on hand and deposits, that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\\n3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF \\nESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY\\n In  applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, management is required to \\nmake judgements (other than those involving estimations) that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised and to make estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF \\nESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY (cont’d)\\n The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. R evisions to accounting \\nestimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\\n Critical judgements in applying the Gr oup’s accounting policies\\n Apart from those involv ing estimates, management is of the opinion that any instance of application of \\njudgement is not expected to have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.\\n Key sources of estimation uncer tainty\\n The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of \\nthe reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below:\\n (a) Impairment of goodwill\\n  Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value -in-use of the  \\ncash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated. The value-in-use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. No impairment loss was recognised during the financial year. The carrying amount of goodwill at the end of the reporting period is set out in  \\nNote 14 to the financial statements.\\n (b) Impairment of investment in subsidiaries  \\n  In vestment in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any impairment loss. The Company follows the \\nguidance of SFRS(I) 1-36 Impairment of Assets  to determine when its investment in subsidiaries are \\nimpaired. The Company evaluates, among other factors, the market and economic environment in which the subsidiaries operate and the financial performance of the subsidiaries to determine whether there are indications of impairment loss and if so, whether the cost of investment in the subsidiaries exceed the higher of the value-in-use of the underlying net assets of the subsidiaries or fair value of investment less cost of disposal.\\n  The carrying amount of the investment in subsidiaries are set out in Note 10 to the financial  \\nstatements.\\n (c) Impairment of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets of non-performing outlets\\n  The Group has certain outlets that incurred losses during the financial year ended 30 September  \\n2023 and 2022. Management performed impairment assessment on the property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets of these outlets based on value-in-use calculations.  \\n  The recoverable amount of the relevant assets of the non-performing outlets has been determined on \\nthe basis of their value-in-use.

A reversal of impairment loss of $168,000 was recognised \\nduring the financial year ended 30 September 2022 due to the improvement in the results of an outlet in Singapore. \\n  Management has performed certain sensitivity analysis on the value-in-use calculations to assess the \\nimpact of any reasonably possible change to the key assumptions applied. \\n  F or the current year’s analysis, assuming all other variables are held constant, a reasonably possible \\nunfavourable change of 5% of the annual revenue growth rates would not cause the estimated recoverable amount to become materially lower than carrying amount.\\n  Apart from the above, management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key  \\nassumptions on which the recoverable amount is based would not cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount of the remaining property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets.\\n  F or the prior year’s analysis, management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key \\nassumptions on which the recoverable amount is based would not cause the carrying amount to \\nexceed the recoverable amount of the property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets.  \\n  The carrying amount of the right -of-use assets and property, plant and equipment are set out in \\nNotes 16 and 17 to the financial statements respectively.3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF \\nESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY (cont’d)\\n Key sources of estimation uncer tainty (cont’d)\\n (d) Loss allowance for trade and other receivables\\n  Management assesses at the end of the reporting period the expected credit losses (“ ECL”) required \\nfor its trade and other receivables and amounts due from subsidiaries.

In making this judgment, management takes into consideration factors such as the likely timing of utilisation and level of future taxable profits together with the long-term business strategy and tax planning opportunities.

The Group has a system of controls \\nin place to create an acceptable balance between the costs of risks occurring and the cost of \\nmanaging the risks. The management continually monitors the Group’s risk management process to ensure that an appropriate balance between risk and control is achieved. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\\n  There has been no change to the Group ’s exposure to these financial risks or the manner in which \\nit manages and measures the risk.   Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis \\nindicated below:\\n  (i) Foreign exchange risk management\\n   The Group operates principally in Singapore and has operations in the PRC and T aiwan, \\ngiving rise to some exposures to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates primarily with respect to Chinese Renminbi and New Taiwan Dollar. The Group relies on the natural hedges between such transactions.\\n   The Group does not enter into any derivative contracts to hedge the foreign exchange  \\nrisk. The Group’s monetary assets and monetary liabilities are largely denominated in the respective Group entities’ functional currencies.\\n   As the Group’s and Company’s principal operations are predominately in Singapore, it is not \\nsignificantly exposed to foreign exchange risk and thus foreign currency risk sensitivity analysis has not been disclosed.4 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, FINANCIAL RISKS AND CAPIT AL \\nMANAGEMENT (cont’d)\\n (c) Financial risk management policies and objectives (cont’d)\\n  (ii) Interest rate risk management\\n   The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because entities in the Group borrow funds at both \\nfixed and floating rate. The risk is managed by the Group maintaining an appropriate mix \\nbetween fixed and floating rate borrowings. Further details on the Group’s lease liabilities and bank borrowings can be found in Notes 22 and 23 to the financial statements respectively.\\n   The Group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed \\nin the liquidity risk management section of this note. \\n   Th e sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates \\nfor its floating-rate borrowings at the reporting date. For floating-rate borrowings, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of borrowings outstanding at the reporting date was outstanding for the whole year. \\n   If the interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were \\nheld constant, the Group’s profit before tax ended 30 September 2023 would decrease/increase by $52,000 (2022 : $9,000). \\n   The Group ’s sensitivity to interest rates has increased during the current year mainly due to an \\nincrease in floating rate debt instruments.\\n  (iii) Credit risk management\\n   Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations  \\nresulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.\\n   The Group ’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its cash and bank balances and trade and \\nother receivables.   Liquid funds are placed with financial institutions with high credit ratings.  \\nThe credit risk with respect to the trade receivables is limited as the Group’s revenue are generated mainly from cash and credit card sales. The Group trades only with recognised and creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant apart from receivables due from an associate.\\n   Other than the receivables from the associates (Note 7), the Group has no significant  \\nconcentration of credit risk. Trade receivables are spread over a broad base of customers.\\n   The C ompany is exposed to a concentration of credit risk as 100% (2022 : 100%) of its \\nreceivables are due from subsidiaries, Jumbo Group of Restaurants Pte Ltd and Jumbo F&B Services Pte Ltd. These subsidiaries have been assessed to be creditworthy and management has assessed that no allowance for doubtful receivables is required. '),\n",

Accordingly, Deloitte will not be seeking re-appointment as the external Auditors of the Company. \\n FK T started its journey in 1968 and has evolved into one of the top 10 accountancy practices in Singapore. Offering a comprehensive suite \\nof services including assurance, tax, and advisory, FKT assists clients in navigating the dynamic landscapes of both domestic and global markets. With a focus on adapting to the evolving business and regulatory environments, FKT has gained valuable insights and expertise through engagements with listed companies and those involved in multi-dining concept food and beverage (“ F&B”) establishments. Mr . Kong Chih Hsiang Raymond (“ Raymond Kong”), a partner with FKT, will be assigned to the audit of the Company as the lead \\nengagement partner. Mr. Raymond Kong has extensive experience over a span of more than 20 years in a wide range of industries, including the F&B industry. Mr. Raymond Kong is a practising member of the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants and is a public accountant registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority of Singapore (“ ACRA”).\\n The Audit Committee has reviewed and deliberated on the proposed change of Auditors and has recommended that FKT be appointed \\nin place of the retiring Auditors, after taking into consideration the suitability of FKT and the requirements of Rules 712 and 715 of the Catalist Rules. Pursuant to Rule 715(2) of the Catalist Rules, the Company must engage a suitable audit firm for its significant  \\nforeign-incorporated subsidiaries and associated companies. FKT is the principal member firm of HLB International in Singapore, where the latter is one of the leading global accountancy networks with a presence in more than 150 countries. FKT will engage the relevant engagement teams from member firms of HLB International in the specific jurisdictions with local domain knowledge to audit the financials of the Company’s significant foreign-incorporated subsidiaries and associated companies.\\n The Board has taken into account the Audit Committee’s recommendation, and considered factors such as the Audit Quality Indicators \\nDisclosure Framework issued by ACRA, the adequacy of resources and experience of FKT, the audit engagement partner to be assigned to the audit, FKT’s other audit engagements, the size and complexity of the Company, its subsidiaries and associated companies, and the number and experience of supervisory and professional staff to be assigned to the audit, and is satisfied that FKT will be able to meet the audit requirements of the Company and the Group. Accordingly, the Board recommends the appointment of FKT as the Auditors of the Company in place of Deloitte.\\n In this connection, FKT had on 4 January 2024 given their formal consent to act as Auditors of the Company to the Board. Assuming \\nthat Ordinary Resolution 5 is approved by Shareholders, FKT will be appointed as the Auditors of the Company, its subsidiaries and associated companies.\\n In accordance with R ule 712(3) of the Catalist Rules: \\n (a)  the outgoing auditors, Deloitte, via its professional clearance letter dated 4 January 2024, has confirmed that it is not aware of \\nany professional reasons why FKT should not accept appointment as Auditors of the Company;  \\n (b)  the Company confirms that there are no disagreements with Deloitte on accounting treatments within the last 12 months up to the \\ndate of this announcement; \\n (c)  the Company confirms that it is not aware of any circumstances connected with the proposed change of Auditors that should be \\nbrought to the attention of Shareholders which has not been disclosed in this notice; \\n ( d)  the Company confirms that the reasons for the proposed change of Auditors are disclosed above. The proposed change of  \\nAuditors is neither due to any disagreement with Deloitte nor the dismissal of Deloitte; and \\n (e)  the Company confirms that it is in compliance with Rules 712 and 715 of the Catalist Rules in relation to the appointment of FKT \\nas its Auditors.  \\n The Board wishes to express their appreciation for the services rendered by Deloitte.\\n(vi) The Ordinary R esolution 6 proposed in item 8 above, if passed, will empower the Directors to issue Shares, make or grant instruments \\nconvertible into Shares and to issue Shares pursuant to such instruments, up to a number not exceeding, in total, 100.0% of the total number of issued Shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) in the capital of the Company, of which up to 50.0% may be issued other than on a pro-rata basis to Shareholders. \\n F or determining the aggregate number of Shares that may be issued, the total number of issued Shares (excluding treasury shares and \\nsubsidiary holdings) will be calculated based on the total number of issued Shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) in the capital of the Company at the time the Ordinary Resolution 6 is passed after adjusting for new Shares arising from the conversion or exercise of any convertible securities or share options or vesting of share awards which are outstanding or subsisting at the time when the Ordinary Resolution 6 is passed and any subsequent bonus issue, consolidation or subdivision of Shares.  \\n(vii) The Ordinary R esolution 7 proposed in item 9 above, if passed, will empower the Directors, to allot and issue such number of fully paid \\nShares upon the exercise of such options in accordance with the provisions of the Share Option Scheme. \\n(viii) The Ordinary R esolution 8 proposed in item 10 above, if passed, will empower the Directors, to allot and issue such number of fully \\npaid Shares upon the vesting of such awards in accordance with the provisions of the Performance Share Plan.'),\n",
